COUNTRY,STATEMENT
United Kingdom,"Mr President, your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

At the time of its foundation, the United Nations was a beacon of promise.

In the aftermath of the Second World War, this building symbolised the end of aggression.

For many decades the UN has helped to deliver stability and security in much of the world.

It has provided a place for nations to work together on shared challenges.

And it has promoted the principles of sovereignty and self-determination even through the Cold War and its aftermath.

But today those principles, that have defined our lives since the dark days of the 1940s, are fracturing.

For the first time in the history of this assembly we are meeting during a large-scale war of aggression in Europe.

And authoritarian states are undermining stability and security around the world.

Geopolitics is entering a new era ? one that requires those who believe in the founding principles of the United Nations to stand up and be counted.

In the United Kingdom we are entering a new era too.

I join you here just two days after Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II was laid to rest.

We deeply mourn her passing and we pay tribute to her service.

She was the rock on which modern Britain was built.

And she symbolised the post-war values on which this organisation was founded.

Our constitutional monarchy, underpinned by a democratic society, has delivered stability and progress.

Her Late Majesty transcended difference and healed division. We saw this in her visits to post-apartheid South Africa and the Republic of Ireland.

When she addressed this General Assembly 65 years ago she warned that it was vital not only to have strong ideals but also to have the political will to deliver on them.

Now we must show that will.

We must fight to defend those ideals.

And we must deliver on them for all our people.

And as we say farewell to our Late Queen, the UK opens a new chapter ? a new Carolean age ? under His Majesty King Charles III.

We want this era to be one of hope and progress¡¦

One in which we defend the values of individual liberty, self-determination and equality before the law¡¦

One in which we ensure that freedom and democracy prevail for all people¡¦

And one in which we deliver on the commitments that Her Late Majesty the Queen made here 65 years ago.

This is about what we do in the United Kingdom and what we do as member states of the UN.

So today I will set out what steps we are taking at home in the UK and our proposed blueprint for the new era we are now in ? the new partnerships and new instruments we need to collectively adopt.

Our commitment to hope and progress must begin at home ? in the lives of each and every citizen that we serve.

Our strength as a nation comes from the strong foundations of freedom and democracy.

Democracy gives people the right to choose their own path. And it evolves to reflect the aspirations of citizens.

It unleashes enterprise, ideas, and opportunity. And it protects the freedoms that are at the very core of our humanity.

By contrast, autocracies sow the seeds of their own demise by suppressing their citizens.

They are fundamentally rigid and unable to adapt. Any short-term gains are eroded in the long term because these societies stifle the aspiration and creativity which are vital to long-term growth.

A country where Artificial Intelligence acts as judge and jury, where there are no human rights and no fundamental freedoms, is not the kind of place anyone truly wants to live.

It is not the kind of world we want to build.

But we cannot simply assume there will be a democratic future.

There is a real struggle going on between different forms of society ? between democracies and autocracies. Unless democratic societies deliver on the economy and security our citizens expect, we will fall behind.

We need to keep improving and renewing what we do for the new era, demonstrating that democracy delivers.

As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, I am determined that we will deliver the progress that people expect.

I will lead a new Britain for a new era.

Firstly, this begins with growth and building a British economy that rewards enterprise and attracts investment.

Our long-term aim is to get our economy growing at an average of 2.5%.

We need this growth to deliver investment around our country, to deliver the jobs and high wages that people expect, and to deliver public services like the National Health Service.

We want people to keep more of the money they earn, so they can have more control over their lives and can contribute to the future.

Secondly, it means securing affordable and reliable supplies of energy.

We are cutting off the toxic power and pipelines from authoritarian regimes and strengthening our energy resilience.

We will ensure we cannot be coerced or harmed by the reckless actions of rogue actors abroad.

We will transition to a future based on renewable and nuclear energywhile ensuring that the gas used during that transition is from reliable sources including our own North Sea production.

We will be a net energy exporter by 2040.

Thirdly, we are safeguarding the security of our economy ? the supply chains, the critical minerals, the food, and the technology that drives growth and protects the health and lives of our people.

We won¡¯t be strategically dependent on those who seek to weaponise the global economy.

Instead, we are reforming our economy to get Britain moving ? and we want to work with our allies so we can all move forward together.

The free world needs this economic strength and resilience to push back against authoritarian aggression and win this new era of strategic competition.

We must do this together.

So we are building new partnerships around the world.

We are fortifying our deep security alliances in Europe and beyond through NATO and the Joint Expeditionary Force.

We are deepening our links with fellow democracies like India, Israel, Indonesia and South Africa.

We are building new security ties with our friends in the Indo-Pacific and the Gulf.

We have shown leadership on free and fair trade, striking trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand, Japan and many others, andwe are in the process of acceding to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Rather than exerting influence through debt, aggression, and taking control of critical infrastructure and minerals, we are building strategic ties based on mutual benefit and trust.

And we are deepening partnerships like the G7 and the Commonwealth.

We must also collectively extend a hand of friendship to those parts of the world that have too often been left behind and left vulnerable to global challenges¡¦

Whether it¡¯s the Pacific or Caribbean Island states dealing with the impact of climate change, or the Western Balkans dealing with persistent threats to their stability.

The UK is providing funding, using the might of the City of London and our security capabilities to provide better alternatives to those offered by malign regimes.

The resolute international response to Ukraine has shown how we can deliver decisive collective action.

The response has been built on partnerships and alliances and also on being prepared to use new instruments ? unprecedented sanctions, diplomatic action, and rapid military support.

There has been a strength of collective purpose ? we have met many times, spoken many times on the phone, we have made things happen.

Now we must use these instruments in a more systematic way to push back on the economic aggression of authoritarian regimes.

The G7 and our like-minded partners should act as an economic NATO, collectively defending our prosperity.

If the economy of a partner is being targeted by an aggressive regime we should act to support them. All for one and one for all.

Through the G7¡¯s $600 billion Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment we are providing an honest, reliable alternative on infrastructure investment around the world, free from debt with strings attached.

And we must go further to friendshore our supply chains and end strategic dependence.

This is how we will build collective security, strengthen our resilience and safeguard freedom and democracy.

But we cannot let up on dealing with the crisis we face today.

No-one is threatening Russia.

Yet, as we meet here this evening¡¦

In Ukraine, barbarous weapons are being used to kill and maim people,

Rape is being used as an instrument of war,

Families are being torn apart.

And this morning we have seen Putin trying to justify his catastrophic failures.

He is doubling down by sending even more reservists to a terrible fate.

He is desperately trying to claim the mantle of democracy for a regime without human rights or freedoms.

And he is making yet more bogus claims and sabre-rattling threats.

This will not work. The international alliance is strong and Ukraine is strong.

The contrast between Russia¡¯s conduct and Ukraine¡¯s brave, dignified First Lady, Olena Zelenska, who is here at the UN today, could not be more stark.

The Ukrainians are not just defending their own country ? they are defending our values and the security of the whole world.

That¡¯s why we must act.

That¡¯s why the UK will spend 3% of GDP on defence by 2030, maintaining our position as the leading security actor in Europe.

And that¡¯s why ? at this crucial moment in the conflict ? I pledge that we will sustain or increase our military support to Ukraine, for as long as it takes.

New UK weapons are arriving in Ukraine as I speak ? including more MLRS rockets.

We will not rest until Ukraine prevails.

In all of these areas, on all of these fronts, the time to act is now.

This is a decisive moment in our history, in the history of this organisation, and in the history of freedom.

The story of 2022 could have been that of an authoritarian state rolling its tanks over the border of a peaceful neighbour and subjugating its people.

Instead, it is the story of freedom fighting back.

In the face of rising aggression we have shown we have the power to act and the resolve to see it through.

But this cannot be a one-off.

This must be a new era in which we commit to ourselves, our citizens, and this institution that we will do whatever it takes ? whatever it takes to deliver for our people and defend our values.

As we mourn our Late Queen and remember her call to this Assembly, we must devote ourselves to this task.

Britain¡¯s commitment to this is total.

We will be a dynamic, reliable and trustworthy partner.

Together with our friends and allies around the world, we will continue to champion freedom, sovereignty and democracy.

And together we can define this new era as one of hope and progress.

Thank you."
EU,"In Senegal last December I met passionate doctors and researchers committed to saving lives. Thanks to international cooperation, they have set up a vaccine production centre at the Institut Pasteur, equipped with the most promising technologies.

A few months later, I met children in Borodianka, Ukraine. I saw in their eyes the horror of war, hearing stories of violence against women. Rape. Torture. Mass graves. Purveyors of death¡¦

Hope in Dakar... Horror in Borodianka...Putting an end to horror and choosing hope: this is the promise of the United Nations. It was the foundation stone for the European Union. And hope is what we want for the whole world.

That is why the European Union is extending a hand to all those who want to cooperate for the common good. To honour the UN¡¯s promise.

I want to speak about hope. But regrettably I will first speak to you about a war.

Every war is a denial of humanity. And all suffering deserves the same engagement in response, whether in Yemen, Ethiopia, the Sahel, Myanmar or Ukraine.

The Kremlin launched a war against the Ukrainian people. And hundreds of millions of women, men and children are being targeted all over the world. Threatened with famine. Deprived of heating. Hit by soaring energy bills. The Kremlin is waging a hybrid war. A war that combines the violence of weapons with the poison of lies.

The Kremlin claims that Russia¡¯s security has been threatened by ¡®the West¡¯ for years. That is not true! The Kremlin is attempting ? in vain, I hope ? to mobilise the world against an imaginary enemy. No-one has threatened, attacked or invaded Russia. And no-one, absolutely no-one, in Europe wanted a conflict with Russia. What interest would we have in putting the security and prosperity of everyone at risk?

The second lie is that this war seeks to prevent an alleged genocide of the Russian-speaking people of Ukraine and ¡®denazify¡¯ the country.

That is not true, and it is despicable. Genocide means concrete acts committed with the intention of eliminating, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic or religious group. So everyone, apart from the Kremlin, has failed to notice that massacres of Ukrainians are being perpetrated on a huge scale by other Ukrainians? And what kind of liberation leads to the killing to this very day of Russian-speakers and the devastation of the infrastructure of their cities?

The third lie is that the aggression against Ukraine is merely a ¡®special operation¡¯, not a war. That is blatantly untrue. This is well and truly a war. And the mobilisation announced a few days ago of hundreds of thousands of reservists simply proves this. Banning the word ¡®war¡¯ by punishing its use with up to fifteen years in prison does not change what it is. It merely betrays its shameful nature. This war is an unprovoked, illegal and unjustified aggression which aims to change internationally recognised borders through force, and that is not acceptable. And because we must stop the Kremlin¡¯s war machine, massive economic sanctions were unavoidable.

This brings me to the fourth lie: that the sanctions are causing food and fertiliser shortages. That is not true! It was Russia which ? even before war broke out ? unilaterally decided to drastically reduce its exports of grain and fertilisers, causing price volatility on the global market. It was Russia which decided to place a military blockade on the Black Sea ports, making maritime trade impossible.

It was the European Union which opened the ¡®solidarity lanes¡¯, that have already allowed more than 10 million tonnes of food products to leave Ukraine by road. And it was the agreement reached by Secretary General Guterres that opened a maritime corridor in the Black Sea to help bring global prices down and start the resupply of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. And today it is the height of cynicism that the Kremlin is again threatening not to extend the agreement concluded with the UN. Once again, it is the most vulnerable countries which will be the main victims. In fact, there is a simple solution to end this food crisis that threatens us: that Russia stops the war, withdraws from Ukrainian territory and lifts the blockade of ports.

Ladies and gentlemen, Excellencies, in this web of lies one moment of frankness and sincerity stands out: a year ago, in a written statement, Vladimir Putin declared, on the basis of historical rantings, that Ukraine is neither a nation nor a legitimate state. This is what is behind his thinking. He is fooling no-one, and sham referendums will not change a thing. In 1963, when the Organization of African Unity was founded in Addis Ababa, the first president of independent Mali, Modibo Keita, said the following: ¡®[I]mperialism is that manifestation of that will to domination of man over man, of a society over another society, of a people over a people, and the desire to impose at all costs one¡¯s own way of thinking, one¡¯s own way of life, and one¡¯s own method of political and economic development on others¡¯.

Imperialism and revanchism. These are the bases for this war of colonisation which has Ukraine as its target, and which is deliberately flouting international law and the UN Charter, to the point of brandishing the threat of nuclear weapons and even using right now the largest nuclear plant in Europe as a military base. This must stop, it is not acceptable. We unreservedly support the efforts of IAEA director Rafael Grossi to restore security at the Zaporizhzhia plant.

Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you and solemnly say to you that the EU does not ask anyone to choose between East or West, North or South. But there is a choice to be made. The EU¡¯s choice is for respect for borders over aggression. Cooperation over threats. The rules-based order over the rule of the strongest.

In 1948, in this forum, one of the EU¡¯s founding fathers, Belgian prime minister Paul-Henri Spaak, directly addressed the Soviet Union: ¡®We are afraid. Because in this Assembly you have made yourselves the champions of the doctrine of absolute national sovereignty. And because we ask ourselves [¡¦] how an international organisation can fulfil the purposes assigned to it, if this obsolete and [¡¦] reactionary doctrine triumphs¡¯.

Today, Russia is a source of fear. The Kremlin has brought war back to Europe. And it is behaving like a blackmailer.

We cannot allow the actions of one of us to shake our staunch collective determination to act for the common good. The European Union is reaching out, sincerely and honestly. We have so many challenges to face together. The effects of the pandemic are painful, especially for the most vulnerable. The Human Development Index is sliding backwards. All too often, women¡¯s and minorities¡¯ rights are still trampled on, or their very existence is even denied. Natural extreme events are becoming more and more frequent, as has recently been the case, dramatically, in Pakistan and Nigeria. The faultlines are cracking open: between developed and developing countries, between democracies and authoritarian regimes. The faultlines are also widening in our different countries.

Multilateral cooperation is collective intelligence in action. It is also the European Union¡¯s DNA. The European Union works as a force for peace, development and the promotion of human rights. European leadership is about building solutions together with you.

It is not for us to give lectures. There is no master, no pupil. It is in this spirit of cooperation that we act at the UN, G7 and G20 and everywhere else. That is why and it is with this spirit that we are reaching out with strategic partnerships.

Together with our African partners, we have reset the parameters. Our partnership is truly forward-looking and one of equals. And here let me reiterate my call and support for the inclusion of the African Union in the G20.

Japan and South Korea, for example, are countries with which we share so much, and we are strengthening our relations every day.

With India and ASEAN, we are expanding our areas of cooperation.

Our ties with the Latin American continent are natural ones. We are counting greatly on the 2023 summit to give a new impetus to our relations.

Together with the Gulf countries we are identifying our shared priorities and holding frank and regular dialogues on our differences.

We hope that the emerging powers, including China, will participate sincerely in collective efforts for peace and development. We believe in maritime security. We believe in stability in the Taiwan Strait. We adhere to the One China policy. But we will not turn a blind eye to human rights violations. Especially in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.

Ladies and gentlemen, we are in this forum, the United Nations, which brings together the peoples of the world, and we all know that a robust multilateral system requires mutual trust. However, the current system is not inclusive and is not sufficiently representative.

Use of the veto should be the exception, but it is becoming the rule. Reform is needed, as a matter of urgency. Let me share with you this conviction: when a permanent member of the Security Council starts an unprovoked, unjustified war which has been condemned by the General Assembly, its suspension from the Security Council should be automatic.

We support the Secretary-General¡¯s proposals on the Common Agenda, and the Summit of the Future in 2024 must serve as a game changer.

The European Union is committed to and stands by the people of the G5 for the Sahel. We are ready to develop resources for the Gulf of Guinea countries. We are also committed to and stand by Mozambique. We support the efforts of Rwanda and the SADC countries that are present here. And together with Josep Borrell, our High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the European Union is sparing no effort to try to reinstate the Iran nuclear deal.

The European Union stands by Afghans, especially Afghan women. We will continue to fight everywhere this obscurantism, which tramples on the rights of women and girls on a daily basis in all areas. And I am thinking now of the women and girls in Iran who are standing up courageously to defend their dignity, at the risk of their lives.

In Yemen a serious humanitarian crisis is unfolding. Yemenis have a right to peace. We support the efforts of United Nations Special Envoy Grundberg to transform the current truce into a sustainable ceasefire.

The peace agreements between Arab countries and Israel are a step forward in the region. But the Palestinian people have been waiting too long, in vain, for the slightest progress for their own future. We must not lose sight of the Palestinian people in the global landscape. The two-state solution, with Israel and Palestine living in peaceful coexistence, in which the security of all must be guaranteed, remains a priority.

Finally, I have personally taken on the role of difficult mediation between the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia. The fighting must stop. The goal must be to resolve the conflict in order to establish lasting peace and prosperity in the South Caucasus.

Dear colleagues, leadership is about showing the way. But it is also about delivering results.

In terms of energy security, we have been far too dependent, for too long. We have jeopardised our security, prosperity and sovereignty.

Energy and climate change are two sides of the same coin. Overcoming the energy crisis means mitigating the climate threat. Protecting our biodiversity and oceans is about safeguarding our future. Climate neutrality is the compass of the European Union and at COP27 in Sharm el Sheikh we will push unreservedly to implement the Paris pledges, and to go beyond. We want a just and fair transition. No one country can protect our planet on its own.

The European Union is honouring its commitment to developing countries. And we expect all other developed countries to follow our example.

Today, almost a fifth of humanity is at risk of descending into poverty and famine. The Russian war against Ukraine has exacerbated this crisis. Initiatives are being taken, by the G7, by the European Union, by the African Union, and by others. The European Union is mobilising almost EUR 8 billion for food security between now and 2024.

But we know more is needed: more coordination, more money and more sovereignty. New, more resilient and more equitable agricultural models are needed. More food sovereignty is essential, particularly in Africa and Latin America. We are ready to extend our hand to support sustainable projects for fertiliser production on those continents, as we have done for vaccines to protect against COVID.

COVID-19 has opened our eyes to our strengths and our weaknesses. Vaccines were produced in record time. And under the leadership of WTO Director Okonjo-Iweala, a balance was struck between intellectual property, scientific innovation and universal access to technology.

However, we know that we need to learn all the lessons from this painful pandemic. This is why Dr Tedros and I, some time ago, launched the idea of a pandemic treaty to strengthen global health security. Negotiations on the treaty are ongoing and must be concluded.

Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude.

We are well aware that we are living through a watershed moment in human history. Sometimes we have abused this word ¡®watershed¡¯; more than ever, we feel that the times we are living through are not ordinary or insignificant.

And I think of Winston Churchill. In 1946, referring to the failure of the League of Nations to avoid World War II, he said: ¡®The League did not fail because of its principles or concepts. It failed because those principles were deserted by those states which brought it into being, because the governments of those states feared to face the facts and act while time remained.¡¯

Like the European Union, the United Nations is a project of hope, founded following the horrors of two world wars.

A few days ago, my six-year-old daughter suddenly confided in her mother and me that she was afraid of war. And that sent shivers down my spine. No parent in the world can bear their child being afraid of war or even less their child being faced with it. No parent in the world can bear their child going hungry or unable to get medical treatment. No parent in the world can bear their child being deprived of hope of a dignified and fulfilling life.

Forestalling or preventing horror in Borodianka, Yemen, Myanmar and elsewhere. Restoring hope, like the doctors in Dakar, and elsewhere, is at the very heart of our responsibility as leaders representing the peoples of the world.

Differences there will always be, but the same blood runs through our veins. The same heart beats within us. We have the same dreams of education and freedom for boys and girls.

I believe in the virtues of collective wisdom. I believe in science and in knowledge and that they will put the world back on the track of hope. We must step it up. And that step up must be taken now and it must be taken together. You can count on the European Union. Thank you."
South Korea,"Mr. President,
Mr. Secretary General,
Distinguished delegates,

I offer my sincere congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi for assuming the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly.

I hope that the 77th session of the UNGA, under your leadership, will bring together the wisdom of each member state so as to shape a better world.

I also express my deepest respect to Mr. Secretary General Antonio Guterres for his tireless devotion as he embarks on his second term.

Under the United Nations Charter, we are called upon to endeavor to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security.

When freedom of any individual in a nation comes under threat, members of the community must join hands to remove the threat and defend freedom. Likewise, when freedom of any citizen or nation in the global community is in peril, it is the community of nations that must stand together in solidarity to defend that freedom.

Our modern history testifies to the process of our solidarity and unity in safeguarding freedom and pushing our civilization forward.

Today, the global community is yet again witnessing freedom and peace of its citizens put in jeopardy. Attempts to alter the status quo by force endangers the lives of innocent people; nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction pose increasing threats to humanity; systemic violations of human rights leave millions of children deprived of their future.

Such threats to freedom and peace must be overcome through solidarity and fearless commitment to the framework of universal global norms consolidated over the years within the U.N. system.

The theme of the UNGA session this year, the ""watershed moment"", encapsulates the gravity of the global crisis confronting us, which underscores the solemn role of the U.N.

The first step in our journey to seek solution that will help us through these turbulent times to find answers begins with solidarity and deference to the universally accepted global norms, working together throughout the U.N. system which has been established over the past decades.

Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, honorable delegates.

As humanity strives to defend freedom and build lasting peace, the UN's role is indispensable.

Genuine freedom is not just being free from the shackles but having opportunities to live life to the fullest with dignity. Genuine peace is not an absence of war but removing conflict and enmity that hold back shared progress of humanity and building the foundation for greater prosperity.

Genuine freedom and peace can turn into reality when we are free from disease and hunger, free from illiteracy and free from want of energy and culture.

In this regard, the United Nations has been exerting great endeavors through the UNECOSOC and UNESCO, among others, yet is now urged to take on a broader role and responsibility.

To tackle the challenges brought on by the pandemic, the U.N. must play a central role in bringing the community of nations together to decisively step up their support for countries with limited fiscal space and technical expertise.

In pursuit of the global agenda for decarbonization, countries with leading green technologies must work to unsparingly share new and renewable energy technologies with others. In the era of digital sophistication, one of the most urgent tasks for the global community and the U.N. is promoting global cooperation to narrow the digital divide which exacerbates polarization between nations.

Countries at the forefront of digital innovation must offer broader assistance for digital education, technology transfer and investment while the U.N. must redouble its efforts to mobilize support to that end.

Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, and distinguished delegates,

The Republic of Korea, notwithstanding the recent fiscal consolidation, scaled up support for those who are in need with resources secured through expenditure restructuring. At home, we are offering more assistance to socially vulnerable groups. Abroad, we increased our Official Development Assistance budget with a vision to achieve a more inclusive development globally.

Just as broadening support for the socially disadvantaged groups lays the groundwork for sustainable prosperity, support for nations of the world facing challenges will render global freedom and peace more sustainable.

As a responsible member of the international community, Korea is committed to playing its due responsibility and role for the freedom of global citizens and prosperity of the global community.

Korea has accelerated research and development for Covid-19 therapeutics and vaccines, pledging 300 million dollars toward the ACT-A Initiative and 30 million dollars to the Financial Intermediary Fund of the World Bank, among others, thereby expanding its contributions to building a more robust global health architecture.

To ensure a more effective response to future infectious disease outbreaks, Korea will host a ministerial meeting of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) in Seoul this November. We are also taking part in negotiations to reach a pandemic accord under the World Health Organization.

In addition, Korea will remarkably increase its contribution to the Global Fund, joining forces with our partners in our fight against infectious diseases including AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.

Turning to the issue of climate change, Korea will scale up its green ODA, help developing countries transition to a low-carbon future and share its innovative green technologies with the entire humanity.

Over the years, Korea has been transferring and sharing its e-government digital technology with developing countries and many others.

The Republic of Korea is pushing forward with its plan to transform the government into a digital platform government. It is an ambitious initiative to remarkably upgrade our democracy, public service, and welfare through digital technology.

We will continue to more widely share our advanced digital technology and data, and spare no effort in providing support and in investing in education.

Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, distinguished delegates,

As we seek answers to the global crisis we are faced with, the viability of the U.N. system and the universal global norms architecture is under test.

The crisis confronting us will only be resolved when we stand firmly in solidarity to share the universal value of freedom and work together to uphold and spread our freedom.

In this vein, we must more firmly support the system of the U.N. anchored in a spirit of freedom and solidarity as well as the normative frameworks that have thus been universally recognized in the international community.

Any attempt to turn away from the U.N. system and universal norms will divide the global community into blocs, further compounding the crisis and turmoil.

We must more rigorously identify the nature and the roots of the problems that lie before us. The international community must vigorously endeavor to share responsibility and join whenever necessary forces to resolve the challenges we face.

Once again, I call upon global citizens and leaders of the world for their resolute and enduring support for the U.N. system and universal global norms as we seek answers in this watershed moment.

Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, distinguished delegates,

The very first mission of the United Nations after its founding was to approve the Republic of Korea as the sole legitimate government on the Korean Peninsula, and to defend the freedom of my country by sending over U.N. forces during the Korean War.

Thanks to such efforts by the United Nations, Korea was able to become what it is today. As such, the Republic of Korea will protect and expand the freedom of global citizens; and together with the United Nations, we will fulfill our responsibilities to promote peace and prosperity around the world.

Thank you."
Ukraine,"Greetings to all people of the world who value peace and unity between different and equal nations!

I wish you all peace!

I thank you that we are united in our striving to restore peace and to guarantee peace for any nation that has become a victim of the armed aggression.

A crime has been committed against Ukraine, and we demand just punishment.

The crime was committed against our state borders. The crime was committed against the lives of our people. The crime was committed against the dignity of our women and men.

The crime was committed against the values that make you and me a community of the united nations.

And Ukraine demands punishment for trying to steal our territory. Punishment for the murders of thousands of people. Punishment for tortures and humiliations of women and men.

Punishment for the catastrophic turbulence that Russia provoked with its illegal war and not only for us, Ukrainians, but for the whole world. For every nation that is represented in this Hall of the UN General Assembly.

I am speaking on behalf of the state, which is forced to defend itself, but has the formula for peace. I am speaking to everyone who wants to hear how to achieve peace.

I will present a formula that can work not only for us, but for anyone who may find themselves in similar circumstances as we did. It is a formula that punishes crime, protects life, restores security and territorial integrity, guarantees security, and provides determination.

There are five preconditions for peace.

Dear Mr. President of the General Assembly!

Dear Secretary-General of the United Nations!

Dear heads of states and governments!

Dear journalists!

Nations of the world!

Ukraine wants peace. Europe wants peace. The world wants peace. And we have seen who is the only one who wants war.

There is only one Entity among all UN Member States who would say now, if he could interrupt my speech, that he is happy with this war -- with his war. But we will not let this Entity prevail over us, even though it is the largest state in the world.

Ukraine showed strength on the battlefield, using its right to self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. And no one will reproach us now or in the future with weakness or inability to fight for ourselves, for our independence.

We are achieving a result in this fight and we see what the end of this war will be, and what will be the guarantees of a stable peace.

The UN Charter proclaims the equality of nations -- and we proved that Ukraine is equal among the equals.

The UN Charter protects the inviolability of borders -- and we confirm our state borderline by expelling the occupiers outside.

The UN Charter stipulates the value of human rights, dignity and life, and we also stipulate them -- with every Ukrainian city freed from Russian occupation.

We did not provoke this war. We held 88 rounds of talks in various formats to prevent this war, just from the beginning of my presidency until February 24 this year.

But Russia -- instead of stopping the crime of aggression, which it started back in 2014 -- turned it into a full-scale invasion. And we have no choice but to defend ourselves. We do it. We push the aggressor beyond the internationally recognized border of the Ukrainian state.

And this is the first item of our peace formula. Comprehensive item. Punishment.

Punishment for the crime of aggression. Punishment for violation of borders and territorial integrity. Punishment that must be in place until the internationally recognized border is restored. Until the aggression stops. And until the damages and losses for the war are fully compensated.

Therefore, sanctions against the aggressor are part of the peace formula. Blocking the trade and relations with the aggressor is part of the peace formula. All this is a punishment.

So long as the aggressor is a party to decision-making in the international organizations, he must be isolated from them -- at least until aggression lasts. Reject the right to vote. Deprive delegation rights. Remove the right of veto -- if it is a Member of the UN Security Council. In order to punish the aggressor within the institutions.

We should not turn a blind eye to propagandists who justify aggression, but apply a full package of personal restrictions against them. That is a punishment for lying.

Citizens of the aggressor state should not be allowed to enjoy tourism or shopping in the territory of those who value peace, but should be encouraged through visa restrictions to fight against the aggression of their own state. Punish for abetting the evil.

A Special Tribunal should be created to punish Russia for the crime of aggression against our state. This will become signal to all ¡°would-be¡± aggressors, that they must value peace or be brought to responsibility by the world.

We have prepared precise steps to establish such Tribunal. They will be presented to all states.

Ukraine will appeal to the UN General Assembly to support an international compensation mechanism.

We count on your support.

Russia should pay for this war with its assets. It is also a punishment. This is one of the most terrible punishments for Russian officials, who value money above everything else.

The second item of the peace formula is the protection of life. The most concrete item.

Now, while the sessions of the General Assembly continue, in the Ukrainian town of Izyum, Kharkiv region, the exhumation is under way of bodies from a mass burial, which happened when the territory was controlled by Russian troops. The bodies of women and men, children and adults, civilians and soldiers were found there. 445 graves.

There is a family that died under the rubble of a house after a Russian airstrike -- father, mother, 6- and 8-year-old girls, grandparents. There is a man who was strangled with a rope. There is a woman with broken ribs and wounds on her body. There is a man who was castrated before the murder, and this is not the first case.

Ask, please, the representatives of Russia why the Russian military are so obsessed with castration. What was done to them so that they want to do this to others?

The only thing that differs the mass burial in Izyum from what the world saw in Bucha is, in fact, the burial. The Russian army was in Izyum for a longer time, and therefore the bodies of the killed people were buried, and not scattered on the streets.

So, how can we allow the Russian army somewhere on Ukrainian soil, knowing that they are committing such mass murders everywhere? We cannot.

We must protect life. The world must protect life. Every state suffering the armed aggression needs the opportunity to protect its citizens and liberate its territory.

If it requires help with weapons or shells -- they should be provided. If you need financial help for this, it should be given. If for this, it is necessary to help with the intelligence data -- just do it. But what is not needed is lies.



We can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory. We can do it with the force of arms.

But we need time.

We tried to speed it up. We tried to implement the basic provisions of the UN Charter for Ukraine through negotiations.

But Russia is afraid of real negotiations and does not want to fulfill any fair international obligations. It lies to everyone. As it is typical for aggressors, for terrorists.

Even now, when Russia talks about negotiations, it only wants to slow down its retreat. Russia wants to spend the winter on the occupied territory of Ukraine and prepare forces to attempt a new offensive. New Buchas, new Izyums, or at least it wants to prepare fortifications on occupied land and carry out military mobilization at home.

We cannot agree to a delayed war. Because it will be even hotter than the war now.

For us, this is a war for life. That is why we need defense support -- weapons, military equipment and shells. Offensive weapons, a long-range one is enough to liberate our land, and defensive systems, above all, air defense. And we need financial support -- to keep internal stability and fulfill social obligations to our people.

Physical and social protection are two elements of any nation's life. So, the second item of our peace formula is the protection of life. By all available means -- allowed by the UN Charter.

The third item of our peace formula is restoring security and territorial integrity.

Look at how many elements of global security Russia has undermined with its war -- maritime safety, food safety, radiation safety, energy safety and safety from weapons of mass destruction.

We are already restoring maritime safety and food security. And I thank Mr. Ant?nio Guterres for his personal involvement. Algeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, Bangladesh, Israel, India, Iran, Yemen, Cyprus, China, Korea, Lebanon, T?rkiye, Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Romania and France have already received Ukrainian agricultural products.

And we have to increase the supply by sea. Both under market conditions and within the UN Food Program, for which Ukraine is always a reliable partner.

By the way, despite all the difficulties caused by the war, we decided to provide humanitarian aid to Ethiopia and Somalia, so we will send them an additional amount of our wheat.

But it is more difficult with other security elements.

On the eve of the General Assembly meeting, Russia fired missiles at the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant. The explosion hit the station buildings -- windows were broken, walls were damaged. The rockets exploded only three hundred meters from the walls of the reactors!

And this is after the IAEA's clear appeal to Russia to stop any hostile activity against any nuclear facilities of Ukraine and, in particular, against the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station -- the largest one in Europe, which Russia has turned into a target.

And that makes all of you a target.

Russian radiation blackmailing is something that should concern each and every one of you, because none of you will find a vaccine against radiation sickness.

The cost of living crisis continues in dozens of countries, it roots in the destabilization of the energy market. It is necessary to remove the main factor of global price turbulence, namely: Russian energy blackmailing.

It is necessary to cap the prices at which Russia exports its energy resources. It is necessary to make Russian oil and gas -- just ordinary goods again. Currently, oil and gas are Russia¡¯s energy weapons. And that is why it manipulates the markets so that electricity, gas, petrol and diesel become the privilege of few instead of being a common good available to all.

Limiting prices is safeguarding the world. This is the way to restore energy and price security.

But will the world go for it? Or will it be scared? Will it be scared of Russian threats?

It is necessary to take only one strong step, after which everything will become clear. The time has come for this.

This step will put everything in place. After the Russian missile terror. After the massacres. After Mariupol. After the burning of Ukrainian prisoners in Olenivka by the Russian military. After blocking the ports. After the strikes of Russian tanks and missiles on nuclear power plants. And after threats to use nuclear weapons, which have become the rule, not the exception, for Russian propagandists,

We must finally recognize Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. At all levels. In all countries that confess the values of peace and protection of human life. Legally. Politically.

If you don't have a legal mechanism, you can make a political decision -- in the parliaments. This is the foundation for restoring global security. If this strong step is taken, doubts will disappear -- whether to take other important steps.

And what is very sensitive -- is the border, the territorial integrity.

When one country tries to steal the territory of another state, it puts all world nations under attack.

Global security cannot be restored without restoring the territorial integrity of the nation which suffered the armed aggression.

So, the third item of the Ukrainian peace formula is the restoration of security and territorial integrity. The fourth item is security guarantees.

Every nation has the right to security guarantees. Not only the largest nations. Not only the most fortunate ones.

We have proposals to upgrade the security architecture for Ukraine, and for Europe and the world, which will not allow any more aggression against us. We are already presenting them to partners.

Proposals for legally binding multilateral and bilateral treaties. These are the conditions for the guarantors to act, and the timeline for their actions to bring results -- results on land, at sea and in the air; in diplomacy and politics, in economy and finance, in providing weapons and intelligence. Each of you, who will receive the text of our peace formula will also see the details of what we offer as security guarantees.

I do not want to compare our offers with the guarantees of any alliances that exist on the planet now. I want to stress that it is always much better to guarantee the security of a nation, preventively, rather than to stop a war after it has already begun.

And the fifth item of the Ukrainian peace formula is determination. Something without which the other four items will not work.

This is our determination to fight. This is the determination of the partners to help us, and also themselves. And this is the determination of the world to unite around the one who fights against armed aggression and to call to order the one who threatens all.

So, all five items of our formula:
punishment for aggression;
protection of life;
restoration of security and territorial integrity;
security guarantees;
and determination to defend oneself.

This is the formula of crime and punishment, which is already well known to Russia. And this is the formula of justice and law and order that Russia has yet to learn. As well as any other potential aggressors.

What is not in our formula? Neutrality.

Those who speak of neutrality, when human values and peace are under attack, mean something else. They talk about indifference -- everyone for themselves. Here's what they say. They pretend to be interested in each other's problems. They take care of each other formally. They sympathize only for protocol. And that is why they pretend to protect someone, but in reality they protect only their vested interests. This is what creates the conditions for war. This is what needs to be corrected in order to create conditions for peace.

All you need is determination.

There was a lot of talking about reforming the UN. How did it all end? No result.

If you look carefully at our peace formula, you will see that its implementation is already becoming a de-facto reform of the United Nations. Our formula is universal, and unites the North and the South of the world. It calls for the world's majority, and encourages to expand the representation of those who remained unheard.

This is an imbalance when Africa, Latin America, most of Asia, Central and Eastern Europe comply with the right of veto, that they themselves never had.

And this is what Ukraine is talking about. And have you ever heard such words from Russia? But it is a permanent member of the Security Council. For some reason. For what reason, not Japan or Brazil, not T?rkiye or India, not Germany or Ukraine. The day will come when this will be resolved.

As for the talks between Ukraine and Russia.

Probably you have happened to hear different words from Russia about the talks -- as if they were ready for them. But. They talk about the talks but announce military mobilization. They talk about the talks but announce pseudo referendums in the occupied territories of Ukraine.

What is true then? The military mobilization in Russia is true. Sham referendums are also true. Russia wants war. It's true. But Russia will not be able to stop the course of history. Mankind and the international law are stronger than one terrorist state. Russia will be forced to end this war. The war it has started.

I rule out that the settlement can happen on a different basis than the Ukrainian peace formula. The further the Russian terror reaches, the less likely it is that anyone in the world will agree to sit at one table with them.

And if my words will be followed by new Russian missiles and acts of terrorism it will only prove the weakness. Russia¡¯s weakness. Its inability to prevail over us, its inability to prevail over the world.

It will only prove that 5 items of the Ukrainian peace formula must be implemented as soon as possible.

We are ready for peace. But true, honest and fair peace. That¡¯s why the world is on our side.

And finally, I want to thank one hundred and one countries that voted for my video address to take place. It was a vote not only about the format. It was the vote about principles.

Only seven countries voted against: Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Eritrea, Nicaragua, Russia and Syria.

Seven. Seven who are afraid of the video address. Seven who respond to principles with a red button. Only seven.

One hundred and one -- and seven.

Friends! If this coalition is against our determination, then I congratulate you all. Because this means that peace will prevail over any aggression, and that there is no obstacle for us to implement the peace formula.

I thank you for your attention!

Once again, I wish you all peace!

Glory to Ukraine!"
France,"President of the General Assembly,
Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations,
Heads of State and Government,
Ministers,
Ambassadors,

It is an honor for me to speak before this Assembly on behalf of France. At this point in time, I am thinking of those who have fought in my country and everywhere in the world for France to be free. Of those who in the past have considered that the destiny of Europe did not leave them indifferent, whether they come from Africa, Asia, Oceania or America, because a part of their freedom and the future of the world was at stake there. I am thinking of those who wrote our Charter and built the walls of this organization to avert the worst, which occurred twice in the 20th century, bringing untold sorrow to mankind.

Let us not forget this debt. It serves the interests of all our countries and indicates the path to peace. It reminds us that there is no other legitimate center of power than that where the Nations sovereignly decide together. It tells us that the universality of our organization serves no hegemony nor geopolitical oligarchy. Yet, this legacy, our organization, along with our choices as Nations, are today facing a choice.

We have now one simple choice to make, and that is between war and peace. On February 24, Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, fractured our collective security with an act of aggression, invasion and annexation. It deliberately violated the Charter of the United Nations and the principle of the sovereign equality of States. On March 16, the International Court of Justice stated that Russia¡¯s aggression was illegal and ordered Russia to withdraw. Russia decided, with such action, to pave the way for other annexation wars, today in Europe, but perhaps tomorrow in Asia, Africa or Latin America.

We may say what we like. I have heard a number of discussions and a number of people speak. However, of one thing I am certain: right now, as I am speaking to you, there are Russian troops in Ukraine and to my knowledge, there are no Ukrainian troops in Russia. This is an irrefutable fact that we must all accept. The longer this war lasts, the more it threatens peace in Europe and peace in the world. It is leading us towards wider, more permanent conflict, where everyone¡¯s sovereignty and security are determined solely by power relations, the size of armies, the solidity of alliances and the intentions of armed groups and militia. Where those who see themselves as strong seek to subjugate those they consider to be weak using all possible means.

What we have been witnessing since February 24 is a return to the age of imperialism and colonies. France refuses to accept this and will determinedly seek peace. In this regard, our position is clear and it is in promoting this position that I have pursued dialogue with Russia ? even before war broke out ? throughout these past months. And I will continue to do so because that is how we will seek peace together, seeking peace through initiatives taken in the years and months prior to the conflict to avert it.

Seeking peace since February 24, with the humanitarian, economic and military support that we have provided the Ukrainian people to exercise their right to self-defense and safeguard its freedom, seeking peace through our condemnation of the invasion of a sovereign State, the violation of the principles of our collective security, and war crimes committed by Russia on Ukrainian soil, and through our rejection of impunity. The international justice system should establish the crimes and try the perpetrators.

Seeking peace, lastly, with our will to curb the geographic spread and intensity of the war. It is up to us in this regard to support the efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency to prevent the war¡¯s consequences for nuclear safety and security, as we will do in the future alongside Ukrainians whose sovereignty over their plants is not up for discussion. We managed to have an IAEA mission visit the plant and draw up a report independently. We are working together to prevent the risk of an accident that would have devastating consequences.

All of us here today know that peace can only be restored with an agreement that complies with international law. Negotiations will only be possible if sovereignly, Ukraine wants it and Russia agrees to it in good faith. We all know as well that negotiations will only be successful if Ukraine¡¯s sovereignty is respected, its territory liberated, and its security protected. Russia now needs to understand that it cannot impose its will through military means, even by cynically accompanying them with sham referendums in the bombarded and now occupied territories. It is up to the members of the Security Council to state this loud and clear and it is up to members of this Assembly to support us on this path to peace.

From this stand, I call on the United Nations members to take action so that Russia renounces its choice of war, assesses the cost for itself and all of us and ends its aggression. This does not mean taking sides between the East or the West or between the North or South. It is the responsibility of all those who are committed to the Charter and to our most precious good ? peace ? because even beyond war, there is a risk of dividing the world because of the direct and indirect consequences of the conflict.

I know that here, in this Assembly, many are harboring a feeling of injustice with regard to the dire energy, food and economic consequences that Russia¡¯s war has had. I also know that some countries here have remained neutral in a way with regard to this war, but I want to say to you very clearly today: those who would like to imitate the cause of the non-aligned movement by refusing to express themselves clearly are mistaken and bear a historic responsibility. The cause of the non-aligned was a cause for peace. The cause of the non-aligned was a cause for the sovereignty of States and for the territorial integrity of each of them. That is what the cause of the non-aligned was. In spite of themselves or secretly with a certain complicity, those who are silent today further the cause of a new imperialism, of a modern cynicism that breaks up our international order without which peace is not possible.

Russia is working to implant the idea today of a double standard, but the war in Ukraine should not be a conflict anyone feels indifferent about. It is close to Europeans who have chosen to support Ukraine without entering into war with Russia. It is far from many of you, but we have all felt the direct consequences and we all have a role to play to end this war because we are all paying its price. Because of its very foundations, this war launched by Russia flouts the principles at the heart of our organization, and flouts the principles of the only international order possible, the only order that can guarantee peace; in other words, respect for national sovereignty and intangible borders.

In this regard, without confusing causes and consequences, who here can defend the idea that the invasion of Ukraine did not warrant punishment? Who among you could consider that the day on which something similar is done to you by a more powerful neighbor, silence of the region and the world would be the best response? Who can support that? Who can believe that it would suffice for Russia to win this war for us to move on to something else? Nobody. Contemporary imperialism is not European or Western. It takes the form of a territorial invasion backed by a globalized hybrid war that uses energy prices, food security, nuclear safety, access to information and movements of people as weapons to divide and destroy. That is how this war is undermining all of our sovereignties.

Therefore, France will stand with the free peoples of the United Nations to address the consequences of the conflict and all the inequalities that it is exacerbating by challenging bloc geopolitics and exclusive alliances because, beyond the direct consequences of the war, the risk we are now facing is that of a new partitioning of the world. Some would have us believe that there is the West on one side that will defend outmoded values to serve its interests and on the other side, the rest of the world that has suffered so much and seeks to cooperate by supporting the war or by looking the other way. I object to this division for at least two reasons.

The first is by principle, and I just mentioned it. Our organization champions universal values, let us not allow the mistaken idea to take hold that there is something regional or adaptable in the values of the Charter. Our organization has universal values and the division in the face of the war in Ukraine is simple: are you for or against the law of the strongest and failure to respect the territorial integrity of countries and national sovereignty? Are you for or against impunity? I cannot imagine any international order or lasting peace that is not based on respect for peoples and the principle of responsibility. Therefore, yes, our values are universal and that is why they can never serve a power that violates these principles. And when, in recent years, we have taken liberties with these same values, we were wrong, but that cannot under any circumstances justify trampling on what we collectively built after the Second World War.

When I hear Russia say that it is ready to work on new cooperation, on a new international order, without hegemony, which is great, but based on what principles? Invading a neighbor? Not respecting borders of those I don¡¯t like? What order is hegemonic today if not Russia? What is being proposed to us? What is being sold to us? What dream is being sold on the good faith of some of us here today? Nothing that lasts for long. Let us not give into cynicism that is breaking up the order that has built us and that alone has enabled us to maintain international stability because these values ? the respect for national sovereignty, the integrity of borders ? and I assure you, we were wrong every time we took liberties with them ? they are the values that we built after the Second World War, after colonialism. Let us refuse to have history falter under the pretext that today it is other geographic regions that are affected and let us not give in.

The second reason I object to this attempt to partition the world is pragmatic. Behind the emerging divisions, there is an attempt to partition the world that ramps up tension between the United States and China. I believe this is a disastrous mistake for us all because it would not be a new Cold War. Several powers of disorder and imbalance are taking advantage of this period to multiply regional conflicts, return to the path of nuclear proliferation and reduce collective security. I therefore think that we must do everything we can to ensure that this new division does not happen because our challenges are growing in number and urgency and require new cooperation.

Look at Pakistan: a third of the country has been flooded, over 1,400 dead, 1,300 injured, millions of people in emergency situations. Look at the Horn of Africa: the worst drought in 40 years and a rainy season which will probably be worse still. Half of humanity now lives in a climate danger zone. Our ecosystems are reaching the point of no return. Look at Somalia, Yemen, South Sudan, Afghanistan: famine is returning. The food crisis is affecting everywhere, and the most vulnerable are hardest hit. 345 million people around the world are experiencing acute hunger, including 153 million children. There are currently 55 civil wars being waged on our planet. There are 100 million displaced persons. While between 1990 and 2015, 137,000 people escaped extreme poverty every day, by 2030 some 345 million could slip back into it in conflict-affected countries.

The most vulnerable people are always the hardest hit by crises, climate disruption, pandemics and rising food prices. These threats are all still present, as well as terrorism which among other areas is affecting the Sahel and Middle East, and nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea, which we have not managed to curb. These are the emergencies facing us. And as time is short, the description I have just given is not exhaustive, but these emergencies are each time either the result of deep-rooted flaws in our international system which was able to reap the benefits of globalization but failed to contain its divisions, threats and imbalances, or the result of divisions among ourselves.

Our shared responsibility is to work to help the most vulnerable, those most affected by all these challenges. As Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India, rightly said: today¡¯s era is not an era of war. Nor is it one of revenge on the West, or Western opposition to the rest of the world. It is an era for sovereign, equal countries to work together on today¡¯s challenges. That is why we must urgently create a new contract between North and South, an effective, respectful contract on food, climate and biodiversity, and education. Now is no longer the time for bloc geopolitics, but rather to build concrete coalitions for action in order to reconcile legitimate interests and the common good.

In the face of the world food crisis, France has now doubled its funding of the World Food Program. With the European Union, we have established ¡°Solidarity Lanes¡± to export over 10 million tons of grain over land since the spring. This was duly supplemented by the agreement of July 22, made possible by the work of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and which enabled 2.4 million tons to be exported via the Black Sea, a route which is still in use. We led the Food and Agriculture Resilience Mission (FARM) initiative which supplies vulnerable countries for a low price with no political conditions and invests in the agricultural production of countries which no longer want to be dependent.

I would also like to announce that France will fund the export of Ukrainian wheat to Somalia in partnership with the World Food Program. We will do this with solidarity, effectiveness and the requirement of full transparency.

Tomorrow, we will convene the African Union, the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the IMF, the development banks and the European Commission to build a viable mechanism for African access to fertilizers, again in addition to the Secretary-General¡¯s initiatives in this area.

On climate and biodiversity, in a few weeks we will meet at COP27 in Egypt. Here too, we must be clear on the meaning of just transition. Our first shared challenge is to eradicate coal. The crisis must not steer us off course. Unless we stop using it, we will exceed the 2¡ÆC limit by even more than predicted. I am willing to invest in Just Energy Transition (JET) financing coalitions, as, for example, we did in South Africa a few months ago, and we must maintain this approach.

But China and the major emerging countries must make a clear decision at COP. This is essential. In this regard, we must build coalitions of State actors with our major international financial institutions around the emerging powers to achieve comprehensive energy production solutions and to change industrial production models, which are the only way to enable these transitions.

Then, the G7 must lead by example. The richest countries must speed up their carbon neutrality programs, but also make an effort to reduce their consumption and share green technologies. In this area, you know that you can count on the European Union. I think we must recognize that for poor countries, it is difficult to tackle extreme poverty while at the same time speeding up the transition. We cannot ask the 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa who still have no electricity to meet the same requirements as major emitters. That is why the financial solidarity and technological solidarity of the richest countries must be strengthened in terms of climate with regard to the poorest countries. They must provide financing, offer solutions and speed up this agenda as we did during the pandemic, but in a stronger, more effective, more determined manner.

Against this backdrop, we must also together protect our carbon sinks and treasures of biodiversity. Along with Costa Rica, France will host the 2025 UN Ocean Conference. Let us make it the COP21 for the Ocean.

With regard to health, we must learn from the COVID-19 pandemic. We must recognize that our first line of defense is the health systems and personnel in the most vulnerable countries. I will stress this crucial point at the Replenishment Pledging Session of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, to which France remains one of the leading contributors. We must also ensure that the WHO sets up early warning systems which we need to prevent the spread of other viruses and we must address human and animal health together. This is the very meaning of the ¡°One Health¡± initiative which France is promoting along with several other countries.

As we are doing with the Global Partnership for Education, we must continue working so that children can go to school, after the pandemic deprived them of that right. It means fighting all inequalities at source and working for our shared future.

So as you see, on all these issues, we must build more cooperation, more partnerships between stakeholders and between West and South, and North and South. This means more commitment to our major institutions. With all this, we want to bring about the opposite of division. Who remained present during the pandemic? Who is proposing financing for the climate transition? Not those who are today proposing a new international order, who did not have a working vaccine, who showed little solidarity, and who are taking no climate action.

In the face of all these challenges, we must show more solidarity and cooperate more, but under no circumstances give in to fruitless initiatives. To achieve this, we must also be clear-sighted about the situation of the poorest and middle-income countries, be they in Africa, South America, Asia or the Pacific. The pandemic has further deepened inequalities, while the war and its consequences are compounding the difficulties for many of these countries. It is thus essential that the G20 meet the goal it set last year to raise $100 billion from special drawing rights.

But we must be more ambitious and stronger. First based on the IMF¡¯s issuance of these special drawing rights, we must implement our commitments. So many countries, particularly in Africa, have still not received any of these funds, and we can no longer tell them that such and such a parliament is deadlocked or that a particular rule is a hindrance. It¡¯s impossible! We will not get there on time. But we must go even further as the difficulty is even bigger. We must increase reallocation of our drawing rights to 30% for the most vulnerable African countries and the poorest countries on the planet.

And along with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, we must re-examine our mechanisms, which are no longer suited to the current situation. The rules we apply today date back to the 1980s. The post-COVID-19 situation on our planet, with faster climate change and the collapse of biodiversity, and also due to imbalances stemming from the war, is increasing our solidarity requirements. We need a new financial pact with the South. That is our true front line, which must bring us together not against a shared enemy, not against false stories or revisions of history, but for the planet on which we all live and for equal opportunities for humanity.

That is our battle, one which unites us all. It simply requires us to make a little more effort, to respect our agreements, to be demanding and respectful of each other. But if together we cannot fight this battle, which is the real one, it will be the source of all future division and conflicts. I invite everyone who wants to build this new contract with us to attend the Paris Peace Forum on November 11 to prepare the G20 in Bali and move forward together, while never renouncing our shared values and guiding principles.

To get to the heart of things, let us not resign ourselves to the division of the world and increased threats to peace, let us not allow further crises to emerge, intractable conflicts to flourish and weapons of mass destruction to proliferate. These are risks we will no longer be able to control in the future without involving the regional powers most directly concerned. And it is precisely this work of involving regional powers which we want to undertake in the Middle East by following up on the Baghdad Conference which we held in 2021, for the stability of Iraq, Lebanon and the entire region.

The P5 Members are no longer the only ones with a say. And that say, which they undeniably have, can now only be effective if we can work more broadly on the international consensus required for peace. That is why I would like us to finally begin Security Council reform to make it more representative, enable it to welcome new permanent members and to continue playing its full rule by restricting the use of veto rights in the event of mass atrocities. We must work together to build peace and the modern international order to serve the goals of our Charter. On this path, the United Nations can unfailingly rely on France. And on this path, each country here today can do so too.

Thank you very much."
Indonesia,"Mr. President, 

Many Leaders have spoken here over the past few days.

We share the same concerns.

The current state of our world is very worrying.

The pandemic persists and global economy remains sluggish.

War among nations is no longer a possibility but has become a reality.

Violation of international law has become a norm in pursuit of narrow self-interest.

Crisis after crisis is unfolding around the world: climate change, rising inflation, food and energy shortages.

 

Mr. President,

History teaches us these phenomena might lead to a huge war.

Let us look at the period leading up to Second World War.

The Great Depression, rise of ultra nationalism, competition over resources and rivalry between major powers.

These are very similar to what we are facing today.

Clearly, we have been handling these challenges the wrong way.

We have been divided instead of united.

We have been working individually instead of collectively.

We have been focusing on words instead of deeds.

The question now what are we going to do about it?

Are we going to continue on the same path? Or are we going to choose a different path?

If we continue on the same path, we would be heading towards a disaster.

But if we choose a different path, we might stand a chance.

So, today I would like to offer you a world based on a new paradigm.

A paradigm of win-win not of zero-sum.

A paradigm of engagement not of containment.

A paradigm of collaboration not of competition.

This is the transformative solution that we need.

 

Mr. President,

Allow me to share with you why we need this new paradigm.

First, to reignite the spirit of peace.

Trust deficit breeds hatred and fear and may lead into conflict.

We witnessed these phenomena in many parts of the world.

We must turn trust deficit into strategic trust. 

And it starts with upholding respect for international law.

The fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable.

I repeat, the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable.

These principles must always be upheld.

Meanwhile, peaceful solution is the only option to settle any conflicts.

A habit of dialogue and cooperation would nurture strategic trust.

These are the rules of the game that we must maintain if we truly want peace.

It is our responsibility to apply them consistently, not selectively, or only when we see fit.

My President conveyed these messages of peace in his visits to Kyiv and Moscow last June.

We must also apply this new paradigm to make a breakthrough in Palestine and Afghanistan.

For far too long, the peoples in Palestine have suffered and longed-for peace.

Until Palestine can truly become an independent State, Indonesia would stand firm in solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters.

Peoples in Afghanistan also deserve a peaceful and prosperous life. 

Where the rights of all peoples, including women, are equally respected.

Where access to education for women and girls are granted.

Without this new paradigm, peace would remain an elusive dream.?

Second, to revive our responsibility for global recovery.

We are concerned that global solidarity is fading away, whereas injustice and selfishness abound, the weak stands small and the mighty takes all.

We are seeing the symptoms every day. 

Trade discrimination is running rampant. Monopoly in global supply chain persists. Global economic governance is used to justify the rules of the strong. 

The pandemic teaches us a valuable lesson that no one is safe until everyone is.

This lesson shapes the priorities of Indonesia's G20 Presidency.

The whole world is pinning their hope on G20 to be a catalyst of global economic recovery, especially for developing countries.

G20 must not fail. We cannot let global recovery fall at the mercy of geopolitics.

We must act urgently to address food and energy crises and prevent a fertilizer crisis from happening.

Otherwise, billions more people would be at risk, particularly in developing countries.

We also need a new paradigm as we move beyond the recovery.

A new paradigm would instill a collective responsibility to attain the 2030 Agenda and fight climate change.

Without this new paradigm, there would not be a strong recovery for all and many of us would be left behind.

Third, to bolster regional partnership.

 

Mr. President,

In many places, post-War regional architecture was built as a tool for containment and alienation.

This phenomenon continues today with mini-lateral groupings.

Many become part of a proxy war between major powers.

This is not what regional architecture should be.

It must serve as the building block for peace and stability rather than undermining them.

ASEAN was built exactly for this purpose.

We refuse to be a pawn in a new Cold War.

Instead, we actively promote the paradigm of collaboration with all countries.

This paradigm will also guide Indonesia's Chairmanship in ASEAN next year.

It is the commitment of Indonesia to reinforce ASEAN's centrality in shaping regional order in the Indo-Pacific; to forge unity as a locomotive for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region; and to ensure ASEAN matters for our peoples, for the region, and for the world. 

ASEAN will also continue to seriously address the situation in Myanmar.

Indonesia is deeply concerned by the military's lack of commitment to implement the Five-Points Consensus.

ASEAN must move forward and not be taken hostage by the situation in Myanmar.

The support of the international community, in particular the neighboring countries of Myanmar, is very important to bring back democracy in Myanmar.

On Pacific, Indonesia will continue to strengthen our cooperation with the Pacific countries.

We will work together to address our shared challenges including on climate change.

As a Pacific nation ourselves, we want to see the Pacific as an integral part of a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific.

 

Mr. President,?

The new paradigm of collaboration must be the spirit of the UN. 

Inclusive and meaningful engagement must trump above take it or leave it approach.

Whereas, the voices of all countries: big and small, developed and developing must equally matter.

This is the very foundation of multilateralism.

That is why we need a strong and reformed UN.

That is why we need a renewed multilateralism that is fit for purpose and that is fit for its time.

That is why we need a multilateralism that delivers. 

I repeat, we need a multilateralism that delivers.

I believe by working together and adopting a new paradigm we can create a better world for all.

It is no longer the time to talk the talk. 

Now is the time to walk the talk.?

I thank you very much."
US,"Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, my fellow leaders, in the last year, our world has experienced great upheaval: a growing crisis in food insecurity; record heat, floods, and droughts; COVID-19; inflation; and a brutal, needless war ? a war chosen by one man, to be very blunt. 

Let us speak plainly.  A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor, attempted to erase a sovereign state from the map. 

Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charter ? no more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbor by force. 

Again, just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime. 

Now Russia is calling ? calling up more soldiers to join the fight.  And the Kremlin is organizing a sham referenda to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the U.N. Charter. 

This world should see these outrageous acts for what they are.  Putin claims he had to act because Russia was threatened.  But no one threatened Russia, and no one other than Russia sought conflict. 

In fact, we warned it was coming.  And with many of you, we worked to try to avert it.

Putin¡¯s own words make his true purpose unmistakable.  Just before he invaded, Putin asserted ? and I quote ? Ukraine was ¡°created by Russia¡± and never had, quote, ¡°real statehood.¡±

And now we see attacks on schools, railway stations, hospitals, wa- ? on centers of Ukrainian history and culture. 

In the past, even more horrifying evidence of Russia¡¯s atrocity and war crimes: mass graves uncovered in Izyum; bodies, according to those that excavated those bodies, showing signs of torture. 

This war is about extinguishing Ukraine¡¯s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine¡¯s right to exist as a people.  Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should not ? that should make your blood run cold.

That¡¯s why 141 nations in the General Assembly came together to unequivocally condemn Russia¡¯s war against Ukraine.  The United States has marshaled massive levels of security assistance and humanitarian aid and direct economic support for Ukraine ? more than $25 billion to date. 

Our allies and partners around the world have stepped up as well.  And today, more than 40 countries represented in here have contributed billions of their own money and equipment to help Ukraine defend itself. 

The United States is also working closely with our allies and partners to impose costs on Russia, to deter attacks against NATO territory, to hold Russia accountable for the atrocities and war crimes.

Because if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for.  Everything.

Every victory won on the battlefield belongs to the courageous Ukrainian soldiers.  But this past year, the world was tested as well, and we did not hesitate. 

We chose liberty.  We chose sovereignty.  We chose principles to which every party to the United Nations Charter is beholding.  We stood with Ukraine.

Like you, the United States wants this war to end on just terms, on terms we all signed up for: that you cannot seize a nation¡¯s territory by force.  The only country standing in the way of that is Russia. 

So, we ? each of us in this body who is determined to uphold the principles and beliefs we pledge to defend as members of the United Nations ? must be clear, firm, and unwavering in our resolve. 

Ukraine has the same rights that belong to every sovereign nation.  We will stand in solidarity with Ukraine.  We will stand in solidarity against Russia¡¯s aggression.  Period.

Now, it¡¯s no secret that in the contest between democracy and autocracy, the United States ? and I, as President ? champion a vision for our world that is grounded in the values of democracy. 

The United States is determined to defend and strengthen democracy at home and around the world.  Because I believe democracy remains humanity¡¯s greatest instrument to address the challenges of our time. 

We¡¯re working with the G7 and likeminded countries to prove democracies can deliver for their citizens but also deliver for the rest of the world as well. 

But as we meet today, the U.N. Charter ? the U.N. Charter¡¯s very basis of a stable and just rule-based order is under attack by those who wish to tear it down or distort it for their own political advantage. 

And the United Nations Charter was not only signed by democracies of the world, it was negotiated among citizens of dozens of nations with vastly different histories and ideologies, united in their commitment to work for peace. 

As President Truman said in 1945, the U.N. Charter ? and I quote ? is ¡°proof that nations, like men, can state their differences, can face them, and then can find common ground on which to stand.¡±  End of quote.

That common ground was so straightforward, so basic that, today, 193 of you ? 193 member states ? have willingly embraced its principles.  And standing up for those principles for the U.N. Charter is the job of every responsible member state. 

I reject the use of violence and war to conquer nations or expand borders through bloodshed.

To stand against global politics of fear and coercion; to defend the sovereign rights of smaller nations as equal to those of larger ones; to embrace basic principles like freedom of navigation, respect for international law, and arms control ? no matter what else we may disagree on, that is the common ground upon which we must stand. 

If you¡¯re still committed to a strong foundation for the good of every nation around the world, then the United States wants to work with you. 

I also believe the time has come for this institution to become more inclusive so that it can better respond to the needs of today¡¯s world.

Members of the U.N. Security Council, including the United States, should consistently uphold and defend the U.N. Charter and refrain ? refrain from the use of the veto, except in rare, extraordinary situations, to ensure that the Council remains credible and effective.

That is also why the United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent representatives of the Council.  This includes permanent seats for those nations we¡¯ve long supported and permanent seats for countries in Africa [and] Latin America and the Caribbean.

The United States is committed to this vital work.  In every region, we pursued new, constructive ways to work with partners to advance shared interests, from elevating the Quad in the Indo-Pacific; to signing the Los Angeles Declaration of Migration and Protection at the Summit of the Americas; to joining a historic meeting of nine Arab leaders to work toward a more peaceful, integrated Middle East; to hosting the U.S.-Africa Leaders¡¯ Summit in ? this December.

As I said last year, the United States is opening an era of relentless diplomacy to address the challenges that matter most to people¡¯s lives ? all people¡¯s lives: tackling the climate crisis, as the previous spoker [sic] ? speaker spoke to; strengthening global health security; feeding the world ? feeding the world.

We made that priority.  And one year later, we¡¯re keeping that promise.

From the day I came to office, we¡¯ve led with a bold climate agenda.  We rejoined the Paris Agreement, convened major climate summits, helped deliver critical agreements on COP26.  And we helped get two thirds of the world GDP on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 

And now I¡¯ve signed a historic piece of legislation here in the United States that includes the biggest, most important climate commitment we have ever made in the history of our country: $369 billion toward climate change.  That includes tens of billions in new investments in offshore wind and solar, doubling down on zero emission vehicles, increasing energy efficiency, supporting clean manufacturing.

Our Department of Energy estimates that this new law will reduce U.S. emissions by one gigaton a year by 2030 while unleashing a new era of clean-energy-powered economic growth.

Our investments will also help reduce the cost of developing clean energy technologies worldwide, not just the United States.  This is a global gamechanger ? and none too soon.  We don¡¯t have much time.

We all know we¡¯re already living in a climate crisis.  No one seems to doubt it after this past year.  We meet ? we meet ? much of Pas- ? as we meet, much of Pakistan is still underwater; it needs help.  Meanwhile, the Horn of Africa faces unprecedented drought. 

Families are facing impossible choices, choosing which child to feed and wondering whether they¡¯ll survive.

This is the human cost of climate change.  And it¡¯s growing, not lessening.

So, as I announced last year, to meet our global responsibility, my administration is working with our Congress to deliver more than $11 billion a year to international climate finance to help lower-income countries implement their climate goals and ensure a just energy transition.

The key part of that will be our PEPFAR [PREPARE] plan, which will help half a billion people, and especially vulnerable countries, adapt to the impacts of climate change and build resilience.

This need is enormous.  So let this be the moment we find within ourselves the will to turn back the tide of climate demastation [sic] ? devastation and unlock a resilient, sustainable, clean energy economy to preserve our planet.

On global health, we¡¯ve delivered more than 620 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to 116 countries around the world, with more available to help meet countries¡¯ needs ? all free of charge, no strings attached.

And we¡¯re working closely with the G20 and other countries.  And the United States helped lead the change to establish a groundbreaking new Fund for Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response at the World Bank.

At the same time, we¡¯ve continued to advance the ball on enduring global health challenges.

Later today, I¡¯ll host the Seventh Replenishment Conference for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria.  With bipartisan support in our Congress, I have pledged to contribute up to $6 billion to that effort.

So I look forward to welcoming a historic round of pledges at the conference resulting in one of the largest global health fundraisers ever held in all of history.

We¡¯re also taking on the food crisis head on.  With as many as 193 million people around the world experiencing acute ? acute food insecurity ? a jump of 40 million in a year ? today I¡¯m announcing another $2.9 billion in U.S. support for lifesaving humanitarian and food security assistance for this year alone.

Russia, in the meantime, is pumping out lies, trying to pin the blame for the crisis ? the food crisis ? onto sanctions imposed by many in the world for the aggression against Ukraine. 

So let me be perfectly clear about something: Our sanctions explicitly allow ? explicitly allow Russia the ability to export food and fertilizer.  No limitation.  It¡¯s Russia¡¯s war that is worsening food insecurity, and only Russia can end it.

I¡¯m grateful for the work here at the U.N. ? including your leadership, Mr. Secretary-General ? establishing a mechanism to export grain from Black Sea ports in Ukraine that Russia had blocked for months, and we need to make sure it¡¯s extended.

We believe strongly in the need to feed the world.  That¡¯s why the United States is the world¡¯s largest supporter of the World Food Programme, with more than 40 percent of its budget.

We¡¯re leading support ? we¡¯re leading support of the UNICEF efforts to feed children around the world. 

And to take on the larger challenge of food insecurity, the United States introduced a Call to Action: a roadmap eliminating global food insecurity ? to eliminating global food insecurity that more than 100 nation member states have already supported.

In June, the G7 announced more than $4.5 billion to strengthen food security around the world.

Through USAID¡¯s Feed the Future initiative, the United States is scaling up innovative ways to get drought- and heat-resistant seeds into the hands of farmers who need them, while distributing fertilizer and improving fertilizer efficiency so that farmers can grow more while using less.

And we¡¯re calling on all countries to refrain from banning food exports or hoarding grain while so many people are suffering.  Because in every country in the world, no matter what else divides us, if parents cannot feed their children, nothing ? nothing else matters if parents cannot feed their children.

As we look to the future, we¡¯re working with our partners to update and create rules of the road for new challenges we face in the 21st century.

We launched the Trade and Technology Council with the European Union to ensure that key technologies ? key technologies are developed and governed in the way that benefits everyone. 

With our partner countries and through the U.N., we¡¯re supporting and strengthening the norms of responsibility ? responsible state behavior in cyberspace and working to hold accountable those who use cyberattacks to threaten international peace and security. 

With partners in the Americas, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific, we¡¯re working to build a new economic ecosystem while ? where every nation ? every nation gets a fair shot and economic growth is resilient, sustainable, and shared. 

That¡¯s why the United States has championed a global minimum tax.  And we will work to see it implemented so major corporations pay their fair share everywhere ? everywhere.

It¡¯s also been the idea behind the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which the United States launched this year with 13 other Indo-Pacific economies.  We¡¯re working with our partners in ASEAN and the Pacific Islands to support a vision for a critical Indo-Pacific region that is free and open, connected and prosperous, secure and resilient.

Together with partners around the world, we¡¯re working to ser- ? secure resilient supply chains that protect everyone from coercion or domination and ensure that no country can use energy as a weapon.

And as Russia¡¯s war rolls [sic] ? riles the global economy, we¡¯re also calling on major global creditors, including the non-Paris Club countries, to transparently negotiate debt forgiveness for lower-income countries to forestall broader economic and political crises around the world. 

Instead of infrastructure projects that generate huge and large debt without delivering on the promised advantages, let¡¯s meet the enormous infrastructure needs around the world with transparent investments ? high-standard projects that protect the rights of workers and the environment ? keyed to the needs of the communities they serve, not to the contributor.

That¡¯s why the United States, together with fellow G7 partners, launched a Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment.  We intend to collectively mobilize $600 billion
in investment through this partnership by 2027. 

Dozens of projects are already underway: industrial-scale vaccine manufacturing in Senegal, transformative solar projects in Angola, first-of-its-kind small modular nuclear power plant in Romania.

These are investments that are going to deliver returns not just for those countries, but for everyone.  The United States will work with every nation, including our competitors, to solve global problems like climate change.  Climate diplomacy is not a favor to the United States or any other nation, and walking away hurts the entire world.

Let me be direct about the competition between the United States and China.  As we manage shifting geopolitical trends, the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader.  We do not seek conflict.  We do not seek a Cold War.  We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner. 

But the United States will be unabashed in promoting our vision of a free, open, secure, and prosperous world and what we have to offer communities of nations: investments that are designed not to foster dependency, but to alleviate burdens and help nations become self-sufficient; partnerships not to create political obligation, but because we know our own success ? each of our success is increased when other nations succeed as well.

When individuals have the chance to live in dignity and develop their talents, everyone benefits.  Critical to that is living up to the highest goals of this institution: increasing peace and security for everyone, everywhere. 

The United States will not waver in our unrelenting determination to counter and thwart the continuing terrorist threats to our world.  And we will lead with our diplomacy to strive for peaceful resolution of conflicts. 

We seek to uphold peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. 

We remain committed to our One China policy, which has helped prevent conflict for four decades.  And we continue to oppose unilateral changes in the status quo by either side. 

We support an African Union-led peace process to end the fight in Ethiopia and restore security for all its people. 

In Venezuela, where years of the political oppression have driven more than 6 million people from that country, we urge a Venezuelan-led dialogue and a return to free and fair elections.

We continue to stand with our neighbor in Haiti as it faces political-fueled gang violence and an enormous human crisis.

And we call on the world to do the same.  We have more to do. 

We¡¯ll continue to back the U.N.-mediated truce in Yemen, which has delivered precious months of peace to people that have suffered years of war.

And we will continue to advocate for lasting negotiating peace between the Jewish and democratic state of Israel and the Palestinian people.  The United States is committed to Israel¡¯s security, full stop.  And a negotiated two-state solution remains, in our view, the best way to ensure Israel¡¯s security and prosperity for the future and give the Palestinians the state which ? to which they are entitled ? both sides to fully respect the equal rights of their citizens; both people enjoying equal measure of freedom and dignity.

Let me also urge every nation to recommit to strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime through diplomacy.  No matter what else is happening in the world, the United States is ready to pursue critical arms control measures.  A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. 

The five permanent members of the Security Council just reaffirmed that commitment in January.  But today, we¡¯re seeing disturbing trends.  Russia shunned the Non-Proliferati- ? -Proliferation ideals embraced by every other nation at the 10th NPT Review Conference. 

And again, today, as I said, they¡¯re making irresponsible nuclear threats to use nuclear weapons.  China is conducting an unprecedented, concerning nuclear buildup without any transparency. 

Despite our efforts to begin serious and sustained diplomacy, the Democratic People¡¯s Republic of Korea continues to blatantly violate U.N. sanctions.

And while the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action if Iran steps up to its obligations, the United States is clear: We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.

I continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome.  The nonproliferation regime is one of the greatest successes of this institution.  We cannot let the world now slide backwards, nor can we turn a blind eye to the erosion of human rights.

Perhaps singular among this body¡¯s achievements stands the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is the standard by which our forebears challenged us to measure ourselves.

They made clear in 1948: Human rights are the basis for all that we seek to achieve.  And yet today, in 2022, fundamental freedoms are at risk in every part of our world, from the violations of ? in Xinjiang detailed in recent reports by the Office of U.N. ? U.S. ? reports detailing by the U.S. [U.N.] High Commissioner, to the horrible abuses against pro-democracy activists and ethnic minorities by the military regime in Burma, to the increased repression of women and girls by the Taliban in Afghanistan.

And today, we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.

But here¡¯s what I know: The future will be won by those countries that unleash the full potential of their populations, where women and girls can exercise equal rights, including basic reproductive rights, and contribute fully to building a stronger economies and more resilient societies; where religious and ethnic minorities can live their lives without harassment and contribute to the fabric of their communities; where the LGBTQ+ community individuals live and love freely without being targeted with violence; where citizens can question and criticize their leaders without fear of reprisal.

The United States will always promote human rights and the values enshrined in the U.N. Charter in our own country and around the world.

Let me end with this: This institution, guided by the U.N. Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is at its core an act of dauntless hope.

Let me say that again: It¡¯s an act of dauntless hope.

Think about the vision of those first delegates who undertook a seemingly impossible task while the world was still smoldering.

Think about how divided the people of the world must have felt with the fresh grief of millions dead, the genocidal horrors of the Holocaust exposed.

They had every right to believe only the worst of humanity.  Instead, they reached for what was best in all of us, and they strove to build something better: enduring peace; comity among nations; equal rights for every member of the human family; cooperation for the advancement of all humankind.

My fellow leaders, the challenges we face today are great indeed, but our capacity is greater.  Our commitment must be greater still.

So let¡¯s stand together to again declare the unmistakable resolve that nations of the world are united still, that we stand for the values of the U.N. Charter, that we still believe by working together we can bend the arc of history toward a freer and more just world for all our children, although none of us have fully achieved it.

We¡¯re not passive witnesses to history; we are the authors of history.

We can do this ? we have to do it ? for ourselves and for our future, for humankind.

Thank you for your tolerance, for listening to me.  I appreciate it very much.  God bless you all. "
