Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/\">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.

      "           it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram\n",
      "           hearkened to the voice of Sarai.\n",
      "01:016:003 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after\n",
      "           Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her\n",
      "           to her husband Abram to be his wife.\n",
      "01:016:004 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw\n",
      "           that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.\n",
      "01:016:005 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given\n",
      "           my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had\n",
      "           conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between\n",
      "           me and thee.\n",
      "01:016:006 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand;\n",
      "           do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly\n",
      "           with her, she fled from her face.\n",
      "01:016:007 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in\n",
      "           the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.\n",
      "01:016:008 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and\n",
      "           whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my\n",
      "           mistress Sarai.\n",
      "01:016:009 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy\n",
      "           mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.\n",
      "01:016:010 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy\n",
      "           seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.\n",
      "01:016:011 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with\n",
      "           child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael;\n",
      "           because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.\n",
      "01:016:012 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,\n",
      "           and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the\n",
      "           presence of all his brethren.\n",
      "01:016:013 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou\n",
      "           God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him\n",
      "           that seeth me?\n",

      "01:016:015 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,\n",
      "           which Hagar bare, Ishmael.\n",
      "01:016:016 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare\n",

      "01:017:001 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD\n",

      "01:017:003 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,\n",

      "           a father of many nations.\n",
      "01:017:005 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name\n",

      "01:017:006 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make\n",
      "           nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.\n",
      "01:017:007 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy\n",

      "           covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.\n",
      "01:017:008 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the\n",
      "           land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for\n",
      "           an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.\n",
      "01:017:009 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant\n",

      "01:017:010 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you\n",
      "           and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be\n",
      "           circumcised.\n",
      "01:017:011 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it\n",
      "           shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.\n",
      "01:017:012 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,\n",
      "           every man child in your generations, he that is born in the\n",
      "           house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of\n",

      "01:017:013 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy\n",

      "           your flesh for an everlasting covenant.\n",
      "01:017:014 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is\n",
      "           not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people;\n",
      "           he hath broken my covenant.\n",
      "01:017:015 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt\n",
      "           not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.\n",
      "01:017:016 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I\n",
      "           will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of\n",
      "           people shall be of her.\n",
      "01:017:017 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his\n",

      "           old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?\n",
      "01:017:018 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before\n",
      "           thee!\n",
      "01:017:019 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and\n",
      "           thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my\n",
      "           covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his\n",
      "           seed after him.\n",
      "01:017:020 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed\n",
      "           him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him\n",
      "           exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make\n",
      "           him a great nation.\n",
      "01:017:021 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall\n",
      "           bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.\n",
      "01:017:022 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from\n",
      "           Abraham.\n",
      "01:017:023 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in\n",
      "           his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male\n",
      "           among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of\n",
      "           their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.\n",
      "01:017:024 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was\n",
      "           circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n",
      "01:017:025 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was\n",
      "           circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.\n",
      "01:017:026 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his\n",
      "           son.\n",
      "01:017:027 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought\n",
      "           with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.\n",
      "01:018:001 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he\n",
      "           sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;\n",
      "01:018:002 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood\n",
      "           by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the\n",
      "           tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,\n",
      "01:018:003 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight,\n",
      "           pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:\n",
      "01:018:004 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your\n",
      "           feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:\n",
      "01:018:005 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your\n",
      "           hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come\n",
      "           to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.\n",
      "01:018:006 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make\n",
      "           ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make\n",
      "           cakes upon the hearth.\n",
      "01:018:007 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and\n",
      "           good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.\n",
      "01:018:008 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had\n",
      "           dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under\n",
      "           the tree, and they did eat.\n",
      "01:018:009 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,\n",
      "           Behold, in the tent.\n",
      "01:018:010 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to\n",
      "           the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.\n",
      "           And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.\n",
      "01:018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and\n",
      "           it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.\n",
      "01:018:012 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am\n",
      "           waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\n",
      "01:018:013 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,\n",
      "           saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?\n",
      "01:018:014 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I\n",
      "           will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and\n",
      "           Sarah shall have a son.\n",
      "01:018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.\n",
      "           And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.\n",
      "01:018:016 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and\n",
      "           Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.\n",
      "01:018:017 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which\n",
      "           I do;\n",
      "01:018:018 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty\n",
      "           nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in\n",
      "           him?\n",
      "01:018:019 For I know him, that he will command his children and his\n",
      "           household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD,\n",
      "           to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon\n",
      "           Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.\n",
      "01:018:020 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is\n",
      "           great, and because their sin is very grievous;\n",
      "01:018:021 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether\n",
      "           according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not,\n",
      "           I will know.\n",
      "01:018:022 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward\n",
      "           Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.\n",
      "01:018:023 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the\n",
      "           righteous with the wicked?\n",
      "01:018:024 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt\n",
      "           thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty\n",
      "           righteous that are therein?\n",
      "01:018:025 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the\n",
      "           righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as\n",
      "           the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all\n",
      "           the earth do right?\n",
      "01:018:026 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within\n",
      "           the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.\n",
      "01:018:027 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon\n",
      "           me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:\n",
      "01:018:028 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:\n",
      "           wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,\n",
      "           If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.\n",
      "01:018:029 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there\n",
      "           shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for\n",
      "           forty's sake.\n",
      "01:018:030 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will\n",
      "           speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he\n",
      "           said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.\n",
      "01:018:031 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto\n",
      "           the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And\n",
      "           he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.\n",
      "01:018:032 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak\n",
      "           yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And\n",
      "           he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.\n",
      "01:018:033 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing\n",
      "           with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.\n",
      "01:019:001 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the\n",
      "           gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and\n",
      "           he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;\n",
      "01:019:002 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into\n",
      "           your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,\n",
      "           and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they\n",
      "           said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.\n",
      "01:019:003 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,\n",
      "           and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did\n",
      "           bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.\n",
      "01:019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of\n",
      "           Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the\n",
      "           people from every quarter:\n",
      "01:019:005 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men\n",
      "           which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that\n",
      "           we may know them.\n",
      "01:019:006 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door\n",
      "           after him,\n",
      "01:019:007 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.\n",
      "01:019:008 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let\n",
      "           me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as\n",
      "           is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for\n",
      "           therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.\n",
      "01:019:009 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one\n",
      "           fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now\n",
      "           will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed\n",
      "           sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.\n",
      "01:019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the\n",
      "           house to them, and shut to the door.\n",
      "01:019:011 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with\n",
      "           blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied\n",
      "           themselves to find the door.\n",
      "01:019:012 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in\n",
      "           law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast\n",
      "           in the city, bring them out of this place:\n",
      "01:019:013 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is\n",
      "           waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath\n",
      "           sent us to destroy it.\n",
      "01:019:014 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which\n",
      "           married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this\n",
      "           place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as\n",
      "           one that mocked unto his sons in law.\n",
      "01:019:015 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,\n",
      "           saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are\n",
      "           here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\n",
      "01:019:016 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and\n",
      "           upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two\n",
      "           daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought\n",
      "           him forth, and set him without the city.\n",
      "01:019:017 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,\n",
      "           that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,\n",
      "           neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain,\n",
      "           lest thou be consumed.\n",
      "01:019:018 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:\n",
      "01:019:019 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and\n",
      "           thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me\n",
      "           in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest\n",
      "           some evil take me, and I die:\n",
      "01:019:020 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little\n",
      "           one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and\n",
      "           my soul shall live.\n",
      "01:019:021 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning\n",
      "           this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the\n",
      "           which thou hast spoken.\n",
      "01:019:022 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou\n",
      "           be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called\n",
      "           Zoar.\n",
      "01:019:023 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\n",
      "01:019:024 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone\n",
      "           and fire from the LORD out of heaven;\n",
      "01:019:025 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the\n",
      "           inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the\n",
      "           ground.\n",
      "01:019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a\n",
      "           pillar of salt.\n",
      "01:019:027 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he\n",
      "           stood before the LORD:\n",
      "01:019:028 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the\n",
      "           land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the\n",
      "           country went up as the smoke of a furnace.\n",
      "01:019:029 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the\n",
      "           plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the\n",
      "           midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the\n",
      "           which Lot dwelt.\n",
      "01:019:030 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and\n",
      "           his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar:\n",
      "           and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.\n",
      "01:019:031 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,\n",
      "           and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after\n",
      "           the manner of all the earth:\n",
      "01:019:032 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with\n",
      "           him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n",
      "01:019:033 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the\n",
      "           firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived\n",
      "           not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n",
      "01:019:034 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said\n",
      "           unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:\n",
      "           let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,\n",
      "           and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n",
      "01:019:035 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the\n",
      "           younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she\n",
      "           lay down, nor when she arose.\n",
      "01:019:036 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their\n",
      "           father.\n",
      "01:019:037 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the\n",
      "           same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.\n",
      "01:019:038 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name\n",
      "           Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto\n",
      "           this day.\n",
      "01:020:001 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,\n",
      "           and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.\n",
      "01:020:002 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and\n",
      "           Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\n",
      "01:020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to\n",
      "           him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou\n",
      "           hast taken; for she is a man's wife.\n",
      "01:020:004 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt\n",
      "           thou slay also a righteous nation?\n",
      "01:020:005 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she\n",
      "           herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart\n",
      "           and innocency of my hands have I done this.\n",
      "01:020:006 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst\n",
      "           this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee\n",
      "           from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to\n",
      "           touch her.\n",
      "01:020:007 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,\n",
      "           and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou\n",
      "           restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou,\n",
      "           and all that are thine.\n",
      "01:020:008 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all\n",
      "           his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the\n",
      "           men were sore afraid.\n",
      "01:020:009 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast\n",
      "           thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou\n",
      "           hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast\n",
      "           done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.\n",
      "01:020:010 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou\n",
      "           hast done this thing?\n",
      "01:020:011 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is\n",
      "           not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.\n",
      "01:020:012 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my\n",
      "           father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my\n",
      "           wife.\n",
      "01:020:013 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my\n",
      "           father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness\n",
      "           which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall\n",
      "           come, say of me, He is my brother.\n",
      "01:020:014 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and\n",
      "           womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him\n",
      "           Sarah his wife.\n",
      "01:020:015 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell\n",
      "           where it pleaseth thee.\n",
      "01:020:016 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a\n",
      "           thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of\n",
      "           the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other:\n",
      "           thus she was reproved.\n",
      "01:020:017 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his\n",
      "           wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.\n",
      "01:020:018 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of\n",
      "           Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.\n",
      "01:021:001 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did\n",
      "           unto Sarah as he had spoken.\n",
      "01:021:002 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at\n",
      "           the set time of which God had spoken to him.\n",
      "01:021:003 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,\n",
      "           whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.\n",
      "01:021:004 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as\n",
      "           God had commanded him.\n",
      "01:021:005 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was\n",
      "           born unto him.\n",
      "01:021:006 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that\n",
      "           hear will laugh with me.\n",
      "01:021:007 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah\n",
      "           should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in\n",
      "           his old age.\n",
      "01:021:008 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great\n",
      "           feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.\n",
      "01:021:009 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had\n",
      "           born unto Abraham, mocking.\n",
      "01:021:010 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and\n",
      "           her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with\n",
      "           my son, even with Isaac.\n",
      "01:021:011 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of\n",
      "           his son.\n",
      "01:021:012 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight\n",
      "           because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that\n",
      "           Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in\n",
      "           Isaac shall thy seed be called.\n",
      "01:021:013 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,\n",
      "           because he is thy seed.\n",
      "01:021:014 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and\n",
      "           a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her\n",
      "           shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed,\n",
      "           and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.\n",
      "01:021:015 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child\n",
      "           under one of the shrubs.\n",
      "01:021:016 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way\n",
      "           off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the\n",
      "           death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up\n",
      "           her voice, and wept.\n",
      "01:021:017 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God\n",
      "           called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth\n",
      "           thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad\n",
      "           where he is.\n",
      "01:021:018 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will\n",
      "           make him a great nation.\n",
      "01:021:019 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she\n",
      "           went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad\n",
      "           drink.\n",
      "01:021:020 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the\n",
      "           wilderness, and became an archer.\n",
      "01:021:021 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took\n",
      "           him a wife out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:021:022 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol\n",
      "           the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God\n",
      "           is with thee in all that thou doest:\n",
      "01:021:023 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not\n",
      "           deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son:\n",
      "           but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou\n",
      "           shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.\n",
      "01:021:024 And Abraham said, I will swear.\n",
      "01:021:025 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,\n",
      "           which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.\n",
      "01:021:026 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing;\n",
      "           neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to\n",
      "           day.\n",
      "01:021:027 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;\n",
      "           and both of them made a covenant.\n",
      "01:021:028 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n",
      "01:021:029 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe\n",
      "           lambs which thou hast set by themselves?\n",
      "01:021:030 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my\n",
      "           hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged\n",
      "           this well.\n",
      "01:021:031 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they\n",
      "           sware both of them.\n",
      "01:021:032 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose\n",
      "           up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they\n",
      "           returned into the land of the Philistines.\n",
      "01:021:033 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on\n",
      "           the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.\n",
      "01:021:034 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.\n",
      "01:022:001 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt\n",
      "           Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here\n",
      "           I am.\n",
      "01:022:002 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou\n",
      "           lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him\n",
      "           there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I\n",
      "           will tell thee of.\n",
      "01:022:003 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,\n",
      "           and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and\n",
      "           clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went\n",
      "           unto the place of which God had told him.\n",
      "01:022:004 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the\n",
      "           place afar off.\n",
      "01:022:005 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the\n",
      "           ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come\n",
      "           again to you.\n",
      "01:022:006 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it\n",
      "           upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a\n",
      "           knife; and they went both of them together.\n",
      "01:022:007 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:\n",
      "           and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire\n",
      "           and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\n",
      "01:022:008 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for\n",
      "           a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.\n",
      "01:022:009 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and\n",
      "           Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and\n",
      "           bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.\n",
      "01:022:010 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to\n",
      "           slay his son.\n",
      "01:022:011 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and\n",
      "           said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.\n",
      "01:022:012 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou\n",
      "           any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God,\n",
      "           seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.\n",
      "01:022:013 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind\n",
      "           him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went\n",
      "           and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in\n",
      "           the stead of his son.\n",
      "01:022:014 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it\n",
      "           is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be\n",
      "           seen.\n",
      "01:022:015 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven\n",
      "           the second time,\n",
      "01:022:016 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because\n",
      "           thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,\n",
      "           thine only son:\n",
      "01:022:017 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will\n",
      "           multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand\n",
      "           which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the\n",
      "           gate of his enemies;\n",
      "01:022:018 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;\n",
      "           because thou hast obeyed my voice.\n",
      "01:022:019 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and\n",
      "           went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.\n",
      "01:022:020 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told\n",
      "           Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children\n",
      "           unto thy brother Nahor;\n",
      "01:022:021 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father\n",
      "           of Aram,\n",
      "01:022:022 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\n",
      "01:022:023 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to\n",
      "           Nahor, Abraham's brother.\n",
      "01:022:024 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,\n",
      "           and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.\n",
      "01:023:001 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these\n",
      "           were the years of the life of Sarah.\n",
      "01:023:002 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land\n",
      "           of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep\n",
      "           for her.\n",
      "01:023:003 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the\n",
      "           sons of Heth, saying,\n",
      "01:023:004 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession\n",
      "           of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my\n",
      "           sight.\n",
      "01:023:005 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,\n",
      "01:023:006 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the\n",
      "           choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall\n",
      "           withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury\n",
      "           thy dead.\n",
      "01:023:007 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the\n",
      "           land, even to the children of Heth.\n",
      "01:023:008 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I\n",
      "           should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for\n",
      "           me to Ephron the son of Zohar,\n",
      "01:023:009 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath,\n",
      "           which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is\n",
      "           worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace\n",
      "           amongst you.\n",
      "01:023:010 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the\n",

      "           the elder shall serve the younger.\n",
      "01:025:024 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,\n",
      "           there were twins in her womb.\n",
      "01:025:025 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment;\n",
      "           and they called his name Esau.\n",
      "01:025:026 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on\n",
      "           Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was\n",
      "           threescore years old when she bare them.\n",
      "01:025:027 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the\n",
      "           field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.\n",
      "01:025:028 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but\n",
      "           Rebekah loved Jacob.\n",
      "01:025:029 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he\n",
      "           was faint:\n",
      "01:025:030 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same\n",
      "           red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called\n",
      "           Edom.\n",
      "01:025:031 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.\n",
      "01:025:032 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what\n",
      "           profit shall this birthright do to me?\n",
      "01:025:033 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him:\n",
      "           and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.\n",
      "01:025:034 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did\n",
      "           eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau\n",
      "           despised his birthright.\n",
      "01:026:001 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine\n",
      "           that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech\n",
      "           king of the Philistines unto Gerar.\n",
      "01:026:002 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into\n",
      "           Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:\n",
      "01:026:003 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless\n",
      "           thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these\n",
      "           countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto\n",
      "           Abraham thy father;\n",
      "01:026:004 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,\n",
      "           and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy\n",
      "           seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;\n",
      "01:026:005 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my\n",
      "           commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\n",
      "01:026:006 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:\n",
      "01:026:007 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said,\n",
      "           She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest,\n",
      "           said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah;\n",
      "           because she was fair to look upon.\n",
      "01:026:008 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that\n",
      "           Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and\n",
      "           saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.\n",
      "01:026:009 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she\n",
      "           is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac\n",
      "           said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.\n",
      "01:026:010 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one\n",
      "           of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou\n",
      "           shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.\n",
      "01:026:011 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth\n",
      "           this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "01:026:012 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year\n",
      "           an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.\n",
      "01:026:013 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he\n",
      "           became very great:\n",
      "01:026:014 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and\n",
      "           great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.\n",
      "01:026:015 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in\n",
      "           the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped\n",
      "           them, and filled them with earth.\n",
      "01:026:016 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much\n",
      "           mightier than we.\n",
      "01:026:017 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley\n",
      "           of Gerar, and dwelt there.\n",
      "01:026:018 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had\n",
      "           digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines\n",
      "           had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called\n",
      "           their names after the names by which his father had called\n",
      "           them.\n",
      "01:026:019 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a\n",
      "           well of springing water.\n",
      "01:026:020 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,\n",
      "           saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well\n",
      "           Esek; because they strove with him.\n",
      "01:026:021 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he\n",
      "           called the name of it Sitnah.\n",
      "01:026:022 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for\n",
      "           that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth;\n",
      "           and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we\n",
      "           shall be fruitful in the land.\n",
      "01:026:023 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.\n",
      "01:026:024 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am\n",
      "           the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee,\n",
      "           and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant\n",
      "           Abraham's sake.\n",
      "01:026:025 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the\n",
      "           LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants\n",
      "           digged a well.\n",
      "01:026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his\n",
      "           friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.\n",
      "01:026:027 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye\n",
      "           hate me, and have sent me away from you?\n",
      "01:026:028 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee:\n",
      "           and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt\n",
      "           us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;\n",
      "01:026:029 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and\n",
      "           as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee\n",
      "           away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.\n",
      "01:026:030 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.\n",
      "01:026:031 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to\n",
      "           another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him\n",
      "           in peace.\n",
      "01:026:032 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,\n",
      "           and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and\n",
      "           said unto him, We have found water.\n",
      "01:026:033 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is\n",
      "           Beersheba unto this day.\n",
      "01:026:034 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the\n",
      "           daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of\n",
      "           Elon the Hittite:\n",
      "01:026:035 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.\n",
      "01:027:001 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes\n",
      "           were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest\n",
      "           son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,\n",
      "           here am I.\n",
      "01:027:002 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my\n",
      "           death:\n",
      "01:027:003 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and\n",
      "           thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;\n",
      "01:027:004 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me,\n",
      "           that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.\n",
      "01:027:005 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau\n",
      "           went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\n",
      "01:027:006 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard\n",
      "           thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,\n",
      "01:027:007 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat,\n",
      "           and bless thee before the LORD before my death.\n",
      "01:027:008 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I\n",
      "           command thee.\n",
      "01:027:009 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of\n",
      "           the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father,\n",
      "           such as he loveth:\n",
      "01:027:010 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and\n",
      "           that he may bless thee before his death.\n",
      "01:027:011 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother\n",
      "           is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:\n",
      "01:027:012 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him\n",
      "           as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a\n",
      "           blessing.\n",
      "01:027:013 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:\n",
      "           only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.\n",
      "01:027:014 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and\n",
      "           his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.\n",
      "01:027:015 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which\n",
      "           were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her\n",
      "           younger son:\n",
      "01:027:016 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,\n",
      "           and upon the smooth of his neck:\n",
      "01:027:017 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had\n",
      "           prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n",
      "01:027:018 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,\n",
      "           Here am I; who art thou, my son?\n",
      "01:027:019 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I\n",
      "           have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit\n",
      "           and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n",
      "01:027:020 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it\n",
      "           so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God\n",
      "           brought it to me.\n",
      "01:027:021 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may\n",
      "           feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.\n",
      "01:027:022 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him,\n",
      "           and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the\n",
      "           hands of Esau.\n",
      "01:027:023 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his\n",
      "           brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.\n",
      "01:027:024 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.\n",
      "01:027:025 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's\n",
      "           venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near\n",
      "           to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.\n",
      "01:027:026 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss\n",
      "           me, my son.\n",
      "01:027:027 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of\n",
      "           his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my\n",
      "           son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:\n",
      "01:027:028 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness\n",
      "           of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:\n",
      "01:027:029 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord\n",
      "           over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:\n",
      "           cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that\n",
      "           blesseth thee.\n",
      "01:027:030 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of\n",
      "           blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the\n",
      "           presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in\n",
      "           from his hunting.\n",
      "01:027:031 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his\n",
      "           father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat\n",
      "           of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n",
      "01:027:032 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said,\n",
      "           I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.\n",
      "01:027:033 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is\n",
      "           he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have\n",
      "           eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea,\n",
      "           and he shall be blessed.\n",
      "01:027:034 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a\n",
      "           great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father,\n",
      "           Bless me, even me also, O my father.\n",
      "01:027:035 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken\n",
      "           away thy blessing.\n",
      "01:027:036 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath\n",
      "           supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright;\n",
      "           and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said,\n",
      "           Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?\n",
      "01:027:037 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him\n",
      "           thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for\n",
      "           servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and\n",
      "           what shall I do now unto thee, my son?\n",
      "01:027:038 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my\n",
      "           father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted\n",
      "           up his voice, and wept.\n",
      "01:027:039 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy\n",
      "           dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of\n",
      "           heaven from above;\n",
      "01:027:040 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother;\n",
      "           and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion,\n",
      "           that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.\n",
      "01:027:041 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his\n",
      "           father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of\n",
      "           mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my\n",
      "           brother Jacob.\n",
      "01:027:042 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah:\n",
      "           and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto\n",
      "           him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort\n",
      "           himself, purposing to kill thee.\n",
      "01:027:043 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to\n",
      "           Laban my brother to Haran;\n",
      "01:027:044 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn\n",
      "           away;\n",
      "01:027:045 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget\n",
      "           that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch\n",
      "           thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in\n",
      "           one day?\n",
      "01:027:046 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of\n",
      "           the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters\n",
      "           of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land,\n",
      "           what good shall my life do me?\n",
      "01:028:001 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and\n",
      "           said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of\n",
      "           Canaan.\n",
      "01:028:002 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's\n",
      "           father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of\n",
      "           Laban thy mother's brother.\n",
      "01:028:003 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and\n",
      "           multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;\n",
      "01:028:004 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy\n",
      "           seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou\n",
      "           art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.\n",
      "01:028:005 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto\n",
      "           Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah,\n",
      "           Jacob's and Esau's mother.\n",
      "01:028:006 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away\n",
      "           to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he\n",
      "           blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take\n",
      "           a wife of the daughers of Canaan;\n",
      "01:028:007 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone\n",
      "           to Padanaram;\n",
      "01:028:008 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac\n",
      "           his father;\n",
      "01:028:009 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he\n",
      "           had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister\n",
      "           of Nebajoth, to be his wife.\n",
      "01:028:010 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.\n",
      "01:028:011 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all\n",
      "           night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of\n",
      "           that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that\n",
      "           place to sleep.\n",
      "01:028:012 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and\n",
      "           the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God\n",
      "           ascending and descending on it.\n",
      "01:028:013 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD\n",
      "           God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land\n",
      "           whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;\n",
      "01:028:014 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt\n",
      "           spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north,\n",
      "           and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the\n",
      "           families of the earth be blessed.\n",
      "01:028:015 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places\n",
      "           whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land;\n",
      "           for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have\n",
      "           spoken to thee of.\n",
      "01:028:016 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the\n",
      "           LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.\n",
      "01:028:017 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this\n",
      "           is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of\n",
      "           heaven.\n",
      "01:028:018 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone\n",
      "           that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar,\n",
      "           and poured oil upon the top of it.\n",
      "01:028:019 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of\n",
      "           that city was called Luz at the first.\n",
      "01:028:020 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and\n",
      "           will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to\n",
      "           eat, and raiment to put on,\n",

      "           the tenth unto thee.\n",
      "01:029:001 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the\n",

      "01:029:002 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there\n",
      "           were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well\n",
      "           they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's\n",
      "           mouth.\n",
      "01:029:003 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the\n",
      "           stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put\n",
      "           the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.\n",
      "01:029:004 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they\n",
      "           said, Of Haran are we.\n",
      "01:029:005 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And\n",
      "           they said, We know him.\n",
      "01:029:006 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:\n",
      "           and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.\n",
      "01:029:007 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that\n",
      "           the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep,\n",
      "           and go and feed them.\n",
      "01:029:008 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered\n",
      "           together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth;\n",
      "           then we water the sheep.\n",
      "01:029:009 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her\n",
      "           father's sheep; for she kept them.\n",
      "01:029:010 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of\n",
      "           Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his\n",
      "           mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone\n",
      "           from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his\n",
      "           mother's brother.\n",
      "01:029:011 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n",
      "01:029:012 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and\n",
      "           that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.\n",
      "01:029:013 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his\n",
      "           sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and\n",
      "           kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban\n",
      "           all these things.\n",
      "01:029:014 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.\n",
      "           And he abode with him the space of a month.\n",
      "01:029:015 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,\n",
      "           shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what\n",
      "           shall thy wages be?\n",
      "01:029:016 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah,\n",
      "           and the name of the younger was Rachel.\n",
      "01:029:017 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well\n",
      "           favoured.\n",
      "01:029:018 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven\n",
      "           years for Rachel thy younger daughter.\n",
      "01:029:019 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than\n",
      "           that I should give her to another man: abide with me.\n",
      "01:029:020 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto\n",
      "           him but a few days, for the love he had to her.\n",
      "01:029:021 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are\n",
      "           fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.\n",
      "01:029:022 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made\n",
      "           a feast.\n",
      "01:029:023 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his\n",
      "           daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.\n",
      "01:029:024 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an\n",
      "           handmaid.\n",
      "01:029:025 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:\n",
      "           and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did\n",
      "           not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou\n",
      "           beguiled me?\n",
      "01:029:026 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give\n",
      "           the younger before the firstborn.\n",
      "01:029:027 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the\n",
      "           service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\n",
      "01:029:028 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him\n",
      "           Rachel his daughter to wife also.\n",
      "01:029:029 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to\n",
      "           be her maid.\n",
      "01:029:030 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more\n",
      "           than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\n",
      "01:029:031 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:\n",
      "           but Rachel was barren.\n",
      "01:029:032 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name\n",
      "           Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my\n",
      "           affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.\n",
      "01:029:033 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the\n",
      "           LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this\n",
      "           son also: and she called his name Simeon.\n",
      "01:029:034 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this\n",
      "           time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born\n",
      "           him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.\n",
      "01:029:035 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now\n",
      "           will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah;\n",
      "           and left bearing.\n",
      "01:030:001 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel\n",
      "           envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or\n",
      "           else I die.\n",
      "01:030:002 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am\n",
      "           I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the\n",
      "           womb?\n",
      "01:030:003 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she\n",
      "           shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by\n",
      "           her.\n",
      "01:030:004 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went\n",
      "           in unto her.\n",
      "01:030:005 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.\n",
      "01:030:006 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my\n",
      "           voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name\n",
      "           Dan.\n",
      "01:030:007 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a\n",
      "           second son.\n",
      "01:030:008 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my\n",
      "           sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name\n",
      "           Naphtali.\n",
      "01:030:009 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her\n",
      "           maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.\n",
      "01:030:010 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.\n",
      "01:030:011 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.\n",
      "01:030:012 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.\n",
      "01:030:013 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me\n",
      "           blessed: and she called his name Asher.\n",
      "01:030:014 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found\n",
      "           mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah.\n",
      "           Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's\n",
      "           mandrakes.\n",
      "01:030:015 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast\n",
      "           taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's\n",
      "           mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with\n",
      "           thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.\n",
      "01:030:016 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went\n",
      "           out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for\n",
      "           surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay\n",
      "           with her that night.\n",
      "01:030:017 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob\n",
      "           the fifth son.\n",
      "01:030:018 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given\n",
      "           my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.\n",
      "01:030:019 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.\n",
      "01:030:020 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will\n",
      "           my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons:\n",
      "           and she called his name Zebulun.\n",
      "01:030:021 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\n",
      "01:030:022 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and\n",
      "           opened her womb.\n",
      "01:030:023 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken\n",
      "           away my reproach:\n",
      "01:030:024 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add\n",
      "           to me another son.\n",
      "01:030:025 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob\n",
      "           said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own\n",
      "           place, and to my country.\n",
      "01:030:026 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,\n",
      "           and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done\n",
      "           thee.\n",
      "01:030:027 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour\n",
      "           in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that\n",
      "           the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.\n",
      "01:030:028 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.\n",
      "01:030:029 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and\n",
      "           how thy cattle was with me.\n",
      "01:030:030 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is\n",
      "           now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee\n",
      "           since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own\n",
      "           house also?\n",
      "01:030:031 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou\n",
      "           shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for\n",
      "           me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.\n",
      "01:030:032 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence\n",
      "           all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle\n",
      "           among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats:\n",
      "           and of such shall be my hire.\n",
      "01:030:033 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when\n",
      "           it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is\n",
      "           not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the\n",
      "           sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.\n",
      "01:030:034 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy\n",
      "           word.\n",
      "01:030:035 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and\n",
      "           spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,\n",
      "           and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown\n",
      "           among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.\n",
      "01:030:036 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and\n",
      "           Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.\n",
      "01:030:037 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and\n",
      "           chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the\n",
      "           white appear which was in the rods.\n",
      "01:030:038 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in\n",
      "           the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to\n",
      "           drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.\n",
      "01:030:039 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth\n",
      "           cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.\n",
      "01:030:040 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the\n",
      "           flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock\n",
      "           of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put\n",
      "           them not unto Laban's cattle.\n",
      "01:030:041 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did\n",
      "           conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the\n",
      "           cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the\n",
      "           rods.\n",
      "01:030:042 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the\n",
      "           feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.\n",
      "01:030:043 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and\n",
      "           maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.\n",
      "01:031:001 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath\n",
      "           taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was\n",
      "           our father's hath he gotten all this glory.\n",
      "01:031:002 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was\n",
      "           not toward him as before.\n",
      "01:031:003 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy\n",
      "           fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.\n",
      "01:031:004 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto\n",
      "           his flock,\n",
      "01:031:005 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it\n",
      "           is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been\n",
      "           with me.\n",
      "01:031:006 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.\n",
      "01:031:007 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten\n",
      "           times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.\n",
      "01:031:008 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the\n",
      "           cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked\n",
      "           shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.\n",
      "01:031:009 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given\n",
      "           them to me.\n",
      "01:031:010 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived,\n",
      "           that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold,\n",
      "           the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked,\n",
      "           speckled, and grisled.\n",
      "01:031:011 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:\n",
      "           And I said, Here am I.\n",
      "01:031:012 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams\n",
      "           which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and\n",
      "           grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.\n",
      "01:031:013 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and\n",
      "           where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from\n",
      "           this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.\n",
      "01:031:014 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet\n",
      "           any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?\n",
      "01:031:015 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and\n",
      "           hath quite devoured also our money.\n",
      "01:031:016 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that\n",
      "           is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath\n",
      "           said unto thee, do.\n",
      "01:031:017 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon\n",
      "           camels;\n",
      "01:031:018 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he\n",
      "           had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in\n",
      "           Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of\n",
      "           Canaan.\n",
      "01:031:019 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the\n",
      "           images that were her father's.\n",
      "01:031:020 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he\n",
      "           told him not that he fled.\n",
      "01:031:021 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed\n",
      "           over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.\n",
      "01:031:022 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.\n",
      "01:031:023 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven\n",
      "           days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.\n",
      "01:031:024 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said\n",
      "           unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good\n",
      "           or bad.\n",
      "01:031:025 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in\n",
      "           the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of\n",
      "           Gilead.\n",
      "01:031:026 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast\n",
      "           stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as\n",
      "           captives taken with the sword?\n",
      "01:031:027 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from\n",
      "           me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away\n",
      "           with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?\n",
      "01:031:028 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?\n",
      "           thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.\n",
      "01:031:029 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of\n",
      "           your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed\n",
      "           that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n",
      "01:031:030 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore\n",
      "           longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou\n",
      "           stolen my gods?\n",
      "01:031:031 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:\n",
      "           for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy\n",
      "           daughters from me.\n",
      "01:031:032 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:\n",
      "           before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and\n",
      "           take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen\n",
      "           them.\n",
      "01:031:033 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and\n",
      "           into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then\n",
      "           went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.\n",
      "01:031:034 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's\n",
      "           furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,\n",
      "           but found them not.\n",
      "01:031:035 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that\n",
      "           I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon\n",
      "           me. And he searched but found not the images.\n",
      "01:031:036 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered\n",
      "           and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that\n",
      "           thou hast so hotly pursued after me?\n",
      "01:031:037 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found\n",
      "           of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and\n",
      "           thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.\n",
      "01:031:038 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she\n",
      "           goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock\n",
      "           have I not eaten.\n",
      "01:031:039 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare\n",
      "           the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether\n",
      "           stolen by day, or stolen by night.\n",
      "01:031:040 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost\n",
      "           by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.\n",
      "01:031:041 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee\n",
      "           fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy\n",
      "           cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.\n",
      "01:031:042 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear\n",
      "           of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now\n",
      "           empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my\n",
      "           hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.\n",
      "01:031:043 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my\n",
      "           daughters, and these children are my children, and these\n",
      "           cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and\n",
      "           what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their\n",
      "           children which they have born?\n",
      "01:031:044 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;\n",
      "           and let it be for a witness between me and thee.\n",
      "01:031:045 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\n",
      "01:031:046 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took\n",
      "           stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the\n",
      "           heap.\n",
      "01:031:047 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it\n",
      "           Galeed.\n",
      "01:031:048 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee\n",
      "           this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;\n",
      "01:031:049 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee,\n",
      "           when we are absent one from another.\n",
      "01:031:050 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take\n",
      "           other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God\n",
      "           is witness betwixt me and thee.\n",
      "01:031:051 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this\n",
      "           pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:\n",
      "01:031:052 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will\n",
      "           not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass\n",
      "           over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.\n",
      "01:031:053 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their\n",
      "           father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his\n",
      "           father Isaac.\n",
      "01:031:054 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his\n",
      "           brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all\n",
      "           night in the mount.\n",
      "01:031:055 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons\n",
      "           and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and\n",
      "           returned unto his place.\n",
      "01:032:001 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n",
      "01:032:002 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he\n",
      "           called the name of that place Mahanaim.\n",
      "01:032:003 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto\n",
      "           the land of Seir, the country of Edom.\n",
      "01:032:004 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my\n",
      "           lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with\n",
      "           Laban, and stayed there until now:\n",
      "01:032:005 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and\n",
      "           womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may\n",
      "           find grace in thy sight.\n",
      "01:032:006 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy\n",
      "           brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four\n",
      "           hundred men with him.\n",
      "01:032:007 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided\n",
      "           the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and\n",
      "           the camels, into two bands;\n",
      "01:032:008 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then\n",
      "           the other company which is left shall escape.\n",
      "01:032:009 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my\n",
      "           father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy\n",
      "           country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:\n",
      "01:032:010 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all\n",
      "           the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with\n",
      "           my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two\n",
      "           bands.\n",
      "01:032:011 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the\n",
      "           hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,\n",
      "           and the mother with the children.\n",
      "01:032:012 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed\n",
      "           as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for\n",
      "           multitude.\n",
      "01:032:013 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which\n",
      "           came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;\n",
      "01:032:014 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,\n",
      "           and twenty rams,\n",
      "01:032:015 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten\n",
      "           bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.\n",
      "01:032:016 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every\n",
      "           drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over\n",
      "           before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.\n",
      "01:032:017 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother\n",
      "           meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and\n",
      "           whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?\n",
      "01:032:018 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a\n",
      "           present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind\n",
      "           us.\n",
      "01:032:019 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that\n",
      "           followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak\n",
      "           unto Esau, when ye find him.\n",
      "01:032:020 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.\n",
      "           For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth\n",
      "           before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he\n",
      "           will accept of me.\n",
      "01:032:021 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that\n",
      "           night in the company.\n",
      "01:032:022 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two\n",
      "           womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford\n",
      "           Jabbok.\n",
      "01:032:023 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over\n",
      "           that he had.\n",
      "01:032:024 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him\n",
      "           until the breaking of the day.\n",
      "01:032:025 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched\n",
      "           the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was\n",
      "           out of joint, as he wrestled with him.\n",
      "01:032:026 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I\n",
      "           will not let thee go, except thou bless me.\n",
      "01:032:027 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.\n",
      "01:032:028 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but\n",
      "           Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,\n",
      "           and hast prevailed.\n",
      "01:032:029 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.\n",
      "           And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?\n",
      "           And he blessed him there.\n",
      "01:032:030 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen\n",
      "           God face to face, and my life is preserved.\n",
      "01:032:031 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he\n",
      "           halted upon his thigh.\n",
      "01:032:032 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which\n",
      "           shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day:\n",
      "           because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew\n",
      "           that shrank.\n",
      "01:033:001 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau\n",
      "           came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the\n",
      "           children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two\n",
      "           handmaids.\n",
      "01:033:002 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah\n",
      "           and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.\n",
      "01:033:003 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the\n",
      "           ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.\n",
      "01:033:004 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his\n",
      "           neck, and kissed him: and they wept.\n",
      "01:033:005 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;\n",
      "           and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children\n",
      "           which God hath graciously given thy servant.\n",
      "01:033:006 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and\n",
      "           they bowed themselves.\n",
      "01:033:007 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed\n",
      "           themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they\n",
      "           bowed themselves.\n",
      "01:033:008 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?\n",
      "           And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.\n",
      "01:033:009 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast\n",
      "           unto thyself.\n",
      "01:033:010 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in\n",
      "           thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I\n",
      "           have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and\n",
      "           thou wast pleased with me.\n",
      "01:033:011 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee;\n",
      "           because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have\n",
      "           enough. And he urged him, and he took it.\n",
      "01:033:012 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I\n",
      "           will go before thee.\n",
      "01:033:013 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are\n",
      "           tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and\n",
      "           if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.\n",
      "01:033:014 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I\n",
      "           will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before\n",
      "           me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my\n",
      "           lord unto Seir.\n",
      "01:033:015 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk\n",
      "           that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find\n",
      "           grace in the sight of my lord.\n",
      "01:033:016 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.\n",
      "01:033:017 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and\n",
      "           made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is\n",
      "           called Succoth.\n",
      "01:033:018 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the\n",
      "           land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his\n",
      "           tent before the city.\n",
      "01:033:019 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his\n",
      "           tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father,\n",
      "           for an hundred pieces of money.\n",
      "01:033:020 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.\n",
      "01:034:001 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,\n",
      "           went out to see the daughters of the land.\n",
      "01:034:002 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the\n",
      "           country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled\n",
      "           her.\n",
      "01:034:003 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he\n",
      "           loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.\n",
      "01:034:004 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this\n",
      "           damsel to wife.\n",
      "01:034:005 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now\n",
      "           his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his\n",
      "           peace until they were come.\n",
      "01:034:006 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune\n",
      "           with him.\n",
      "01:034:007 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard\n",
      "           it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth,\n",
      "           because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's\n",
      "           daughter: which thing ought not to be done.\n",
      "01:034:008 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son\n",
      "           Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to\n",
      "           wife.\n",
      "01:034:009 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto\n",

      "01:034:014 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our\n",

      "01:034:018 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.\n",

      "01:034:021 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in\n",
      "           the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large\n",
      "           enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives,\n",
      "           and let us give them our daughters.\n",
      "01:034:022 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,\n",

      "           circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.\n",
      "01:034:025 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,\n",
      "           that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's\n",
      "           brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city\n",
      "           boldly, and slew all the males.\n",
      "01:034:026 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the\n",

      "01:034:027 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,\n",
      "           because they had defiled their sister.\n",
      "01:034:028 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and\n",

      "01:034:029 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their\n",
      "           wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the\n",

      "01:034:030 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make\n",
      "           me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the\n",
      "           Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they\n",

      "           I shall be destroyed, I and my house.\n",
      "01:034:031 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an\n",
      "           harlot?\n",
      "01:035:001 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell\n",
      "           there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto\n",
      "           thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.\n",
      "01:035:002 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with\n",

      "           clean, and change your garments:\n",
      "01:035:003 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there\n",
      "           an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress,\n",
      "           and was with me in the way which I went.\n",
      "01:035:004 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in\n",
      "           their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears;\n",
      "           and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.\n",
      "01:035:005 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities\n",
      "           that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the\n",
      "           sons of Jacob.\n",
      "01:035:006 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,\n",

      "01:035:007 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:\n",
      "           because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the\n",

      "01:035:008 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath\n",

      "01:035:009 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of\n",
      "           Padanaram, and blessed him.\n",
      "01:035:010 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not\n",
      "           be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he\n",
      "           called his name Israel.\n",
      "01:035:011 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and\n",
      "           multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee,\n",
      "           and kings shall come out of thy loins;\n",
      "01:035:012 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will\n",
      "           give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.\n",
      "01:035:013 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with\n",
      "           him.\n",
      "01:035:014 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with\n",
      "           him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering\n",
      "           thereon, and he poured oil thereon.\n",
      "01:035:015 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with\n",
      "           him, Bethel.\n",
      "01:035:016 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way\n",

      "01:035:019 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which\n",

      "           to Shechem.\n",
      "01:037:015 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in\n",
      "           the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?\n",
      "01:037:016 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where\n",
      "           they feed their flocks.\n",
      "01:037:017 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them\n",
      "           say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren,\n",
      "           and found them in Dothan.\n",
      "01:037:018 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto\n",
      "           them, they conspired against him to slay him.\n",
      "01:037:019 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.\n",
      "01:037:020 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into\n",
      "           some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him:\n",
      "           and we shall see what will become of his dreams.\n",
      "01:037:021 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;\n",
      "           and said, Let us not kill him.\n",
      "01:037:022 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into\n",
      "           this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;\n",
      "           that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to\n",
      "           his father again.\n",
      "01:037:023 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,\n",
      "           that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many\n",
      "           colours that was on him;\n",
      "01:037:024 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was\n",
      "           empty, there was no water in it.\n",
      "01:037:025 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes\n",
      "           and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from\n",
      "           Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh,\n",
      "           going to carry it down to Egypt.\n",
      "01:037:026 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay\n",
      "           our brother, and conceal his blood?\n",
      "01:037:027 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our\n",
      "           hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his\n",
      "           brethren were content.\n",
      "01:037:028 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and\n",
      "           lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the\n",
      "           Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought\n",
      "           Joseph into Egypt.\n",
      "01:037:029 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not\n",
      "           in the pit; and he rent his clothes.\n",
      "01:037:030 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;\n",
      "           and I, whither shall I go?\n",
      "01:037:031 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats,\n",
      "           and dipped the coat in the blood;\n",
      "01:037:032 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to\n",
      "           their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether\n",
      "           it be thy son's coat or no.\n",
      "01:037:033 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast\n",
      "           hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.\n",
      "01:037:034 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,\n",
      "           and mourned for his son many days.\n",
      "01:037:035 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;\n",
      "           but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go\n",
      "           down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept\n",
      "           for him.\n",
      "01:037:036 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an\n",
      "           officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.\n",
      "01:038:001 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from\n",
      "           his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose\n",
      "           name was Hirah.\n",
      "01:038:002 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose\n",
      "           name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.\n",
      "01:038:003 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.\n",
      "01:038:004 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his\n",
      "           name Onan.\n",
      "01:038:005 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his\n",
      "           name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.\n",
      "01:038:006 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was\n",
      "           Tamar.\n",
      "01:038:007 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the\n",
      "           LORD; and the LORD slew him.\n",
      "01:038:008 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and\n",
      "           marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.\n",
      "01:038:009 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to\n",
      "           pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled\n",
      "           it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his\n",
      "           brother.\n",
      "01:038:010 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he\n",
      "           slew him also.\n",
      "01:038:011 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow\n",
      "           at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he\n",
      "           said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And\n",
      "           Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.\n",
      "01:038:012 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife\n",
      "           died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his\n",
      "           sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the\n",
      "           Adullamite.\n",
      "01:038:013 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth\n",
      "           up to Timnath to shear his sheep.\n",
      "01:038:014 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her\n",
      "           with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place,\n",
      "           which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was\n",
      "           grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.\n",
      "01:038:015 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because\n",
      "           she had covered her face.\n",
      "01:038:016 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray\n",
      "           thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was\n",
      "           his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me,\n",
      "           that thou mayest come in unto me?\n",
      "01:038:017 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she\n",
      "           said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?\n",
      "01:038:018 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy\n",
      "           signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine\n",
      "           hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she\n",
      "           conceived by him.\n",
      "01:038:019 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her,\n",
      "           and put on the garments of her widowhood.\n",
      "01:038:020 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the\n",
      "           Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but\n",
      "           he found her not.\n",
      "01:038:021 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the\n",
      "           harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There\n",
      "           was no harlot in this place.\n",
      "01:038:022 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and\n",
      "           also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in\n",
      "           this place.\n",
      "01:038:023 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:\n",
      "           behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.\n",
      "01:038:024 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told\n",
      "           Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the\n",
      "           harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And\n",
      "           Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.\n",
      "01:038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,\n",
      "           saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she\n",
      "           said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and\n",
      "           bracelets, and staff.\n",
      "01:038:026 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more\n",
      "           righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my\n",
      "           son. And he knew her again no more.\n",
      "01:038:027 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,\n",
      "           twins were in her womb.\n",
      "01:038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out\n",
      "           his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a\n",
      "           scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.\n",
      "01:038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,\n",
      "           his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken\n",
      "           forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called\n",
      "           Pharez.\n",
      "01:038:030 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet\n",
      "           thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.\n",
      "01:039:001 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer\n",
      "           of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of\n",
      "           the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down\n",
      "           thither.\n",
      "01:039:002 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and\n",
      "           he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.\n",
      "01:039:003 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the\n",
      "           LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.\n",
      "01:039:004 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he\n",
      "           made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put\n",
      "           into his hand.\n",
      "01:039:005 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him\n",
      "           overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD\n",
      "           blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the\n",
      "           blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house,\n",
      "           and in the field.\n",
      "01:039:006 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not\n",
      "           ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was\n",
      "           a goodly person, and well favoured.\n",
      "01:039:007 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife\n",
      "           cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.\n",
      "01:039:008 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my\n",
      "           master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath\n",
      "           committed all that he hath to my hand;\n",
      "01:039:009 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he\n",
      "           kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his\n",
      "           wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against\n",
      "           God?\n",
      "01:039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that\n",
      "           he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.\n",
      "01:039:011 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the\n",
      "           house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the\n",
      "           house there within.\n",
      "01:039:012 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he\n",
      "           left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.\n",
      "01:039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment\n",
      "           in her hand, and was fled forth,\n",
      "01:039:014 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto\n",
      "           them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to\n",
      "           mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a\n",
      "           loud voice:\n",
      "01:039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice\n",
      "           and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got\n",
      "           him out.\n",
      "01:039:016 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.\n",
      "01:039:017 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The\n",
      "           Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto\n",
      "           me to mock me:\n",
      "01:039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that\n",
      "           he left his garment with me, and fled out.\n",
      "01:039:019 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his\n",
      "           wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did\n",
      "           thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.\n",
      "01:039:020 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a\n",
      "           place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there\n",
      "           in the prison.\n",
      "01:039:021 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave\n",
      "           him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n",
      "01:039:022 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all\n",
      "           the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did\n",
      "           there, he was the doer of it.\n",
      "01:039:023 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was\n",
      "           under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which\n",
      "           he did, the LORD made it to prosper.\n",
      "01:040:001 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the\n",
      "           king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king\n",
      "           of Egypt.\n",
      "01:040:002 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the\n",
      "           chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.\n",
      "01:040:003 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the\n",
      "           guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.\n",
      "01:040:004 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he\n",
      "           served them: and they continued a season in ward.\n",
      "01:040:005 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in\n",
      "           one night, each man according to the interpretation of his\n",
      "           dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which\n",
      "           were bound in the prison.\n",
      "01:040:006 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon\n",
      "           them, and, behold, they were sad.\n",
      "01:040:007 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward\n",
      "           of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to\n",
      "           day?\n",
      "01:040:008 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is\n",
      "           no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not\n",
      "           interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.\n",
      "01:040:009 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to\n",
      "           him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;\n",
      "01:040:010 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it\n",
      "           budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof\n",
      "           brought forth ripe grapes:\n",
      "01:040:011 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and\n",
      "           pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into\n",
      "           Pharaoh's hand.\n",
      "01:040:012 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:\n",
      "           The three branches are three days:\n",
      "01:040:013 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and\n",
      "           restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's\n",
      "           cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his\n",
      "           butler.\n",
      "01:040:014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew\n",
      "           kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto\n",
      "           Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:\n",
      "01:040:015 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:\n",
      "           and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into\n",
      "           the dungeon.\n",
      "01:040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he\n",
      "           said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had\n",
      "           three white baskets on my head:\n",
      "01:040:017 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of\n",
      "           bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the\n",
      "           basket upon my head.\n",
      "01:040:018 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation\n",
      "           thereof: The three baskets are three days:\n",
      "01:040:019 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off\n",
      "           thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat\n",
      "           thy flesh from off thee.\n",
      "01:040:020 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's\n",
      "           birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he\n",
      "           lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker\n",
      "           among his servants.\n",
      "01:040:021 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;\n",
      "           and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:\n",
      "01:040:022 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to\n",
      "           them.\n",
      "01:040:023 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.\n",
      "01:041:001 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh\n",
      "           dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.\n",
      "01:041:002 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well\n",
      "           favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.\n",
      "01:041:003 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the\n",
      "           river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other\n",
      "           kine upon the brink of the river.\n",
      "01:041:004 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven\n",
      "           well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.\n",
      "01:041:005 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven\n",
      "           ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.\n",
      "01:041:006 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind\n",
      "           sprung up after them.\n",
      "01:041:007 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.\n",
      "           And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.\n",
      "01:041:008 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was\n",
      "           troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of\n",
      "           Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his\n",
      "           dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto\n",
      "           Pharaoh.\n",
      "01:041:009 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do\n",
      "           remember my faults this day:\n",
      "01:041:010 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the\n",
      "           captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:\n",
      "01:041:011 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each\n",
      "           man according to the interpretation of his dream.\n",
      "01:041:012 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to\n",
      "           the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted\n",
      "           to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did\n",
      "           interpret.\n",
      "01:041:013 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he\n",
      "           restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.\n",
      "01:041:014 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him\n",
      "           hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed\n",
      "           his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.\n",
      "01:041:015 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and\n",
      "           there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of\n",
      "           thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.\n",
      "01:041:016 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God\n",
      "           shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.\n",
      "01:041:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood\n",
      "           upon the bank of the river:\n",
      "01:041:018 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,\n",
      "           fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:\n",
      "01:041:019 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and\n",
      "           very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all\n",
      "           the land of Egypt for badness:\n",
      "01:041:020 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first\n",
      "           seven fat kine:\n",
      "01:041:021 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that\n",
      "           they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at\n",
      "           the beginning. So I awoke.\n",
      "01:041:022 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one\n",
      "           stalk, full and good:\n",
      "01:041:023 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the\n",
      "           east wind, sprung up after them:\n",
      "01:041:024 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told\n",
      "           this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare\n",
      "           it to me.\n",
      "01:041:025 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God\n",
      "           hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.\n",
      "01:041:026 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears\n",
      "           are seven years: the dream is one.\n",
      "01:041:027 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after\n",
      "           them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with\n",
      "           the east wind shall be seven years of famine.\n",
      "01:041:028 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God\n",
      "           is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.\n",
      "01:041:029 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all\n",
      "           the land of Egypt:\n",
      "01:041:030 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and\n",
      "           all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and\n",
      "           the famine shall consume the land;\n",
      "01:041:031 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of\n",
      "           that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.\n",
      "01:041:032 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is\n",
      "           because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly\n",
      "           bring it to pass.\n",
      "01:041:033 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,\n",
      "           and set him over the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:034 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the\n",
      "           land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the\n",
      "           seven plenteous years.\n",
      "01:041:035 And let them gather all the food of those good years that\n",
      "           come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them\n",
      "           keep food in the cities.\n",
      "01:041:036 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven\n",
      "           years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the\n",
      "           land perish not through the famine.\n",
      "01:041:037 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes\n",
      "           of all his servants.\n",
      "01:041:038 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as\n",
      "           this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?\n",
      "01:041:039 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed\n",
      "           thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:\n",
      "01:041:040 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall\n",
      "           all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater\n",
      "           than thou.\n",
      "01:041:041 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all\n",
      "           the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:042 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon\n",
      "           Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and\n",
      "           put a gold chain about his neck;\n",
      "01:041:043 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had;\n",
      "           and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler\n",
      "           over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:044 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee\n",
      "           shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of\n",
      "           Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:045 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave\n",
      "           him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.\n",
      "           And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:046 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh\n",
      "           king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of\n",
      "           Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:047 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by\n",
      "           handfuls.\n",
      "01:041:048 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were\n",
      "           in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the\n",
      "           food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he\n",
      "           up in the same.\n",
      "01:041:049 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,\n",
      "           until he left numbering; for it was without number.\n",
      "01:041:050 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine\n",
      "           came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On\n",
      "           bare unto him.\n",
      "01:041:051 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,\n",
      "           said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's\n",
      "           house.\n",
      "01:041:052 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath\n",
      "           caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.\n",
      "01:041:053 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of\n",
      "           Egypt, were ended.\n",
      "01:041:054 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as\n",
      "           Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all\n",
      "           the land of Egypt there was bread.\n",
      "01:041:055 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried\n",
      "           to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians,\n",
      "           Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.\n",
      "01:041:056 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph\n",
      "           opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and\n",
      "           the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:057 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;\n",
      "           because that the famine was so sore in all lands.\n",
      "01:042:001 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said\n",
      "           unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?\n",
      "01:042:002 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt:\n",
      "           get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may\n",
      "           live, and not die.\n",
      "01:042:003 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.\n",
      "01:042:004 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his\n",
      "           brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.\n",
      "01:042:005 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:\n",
      "           for the famine was in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "01:042:006 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that\n",
      "           sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren\n",
      "           came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to\n",
      "           the earth.\n",
      "01:042:007 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made\n",
      "           himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he\n",
      "           said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land\n",
      "           of Canaan to buy food.\n",
      "01:042:008 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.\n",
      "01:042:009 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and\n",
      "           said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land\n",
      "           ye are come.\n",
      "01:042:010 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy\n",
      "           servants come.\n",
      "01:042:011 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are\n",
      "           no spies.\n",
      "01:042:012 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the\n",
      "           land ye are come.\n",
      "01:042:013 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of\n",
      "           one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is\n",
      "           this day with our father, and one is not.\n",
      "01:042:014 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,\n",
      "           saying, Ye are spies:\n",
      "01:042:015 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not\n",
      "           go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.\n",
      "01:042:016 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall\n",
      "           be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether\n",
      "           there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh\n",
      "           surely ye are spies.\n",
      "01:042:017 And he put them all together into ward three days.\n",
      "01:042:018 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;\n",
      "           for I fear God:\n",
      "01:042:019 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the\n",
      "           house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your\n",
      "           houses:\n",
      "01:042:020 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words\n",
      "           be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.\n",
      "01:042:021 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning\n",
      "           our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he\n",
      "           besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress\n",
      "           come upon us.\n",
      "01:042:022 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you,\n",
      "           saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear?\n",
      "           therefore, behold, also his blood is required.\n",
      "01:042:023 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake\n",
      "           unto them by an interpreter.\n",
      "01:042:024 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned\n",
      "           to them again, and communed with them, and took from them\n",
      "           Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.\n",
      "01:042:025 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to\n",
      "           restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them\n",
      "           provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.\n",
      "01:042:026 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.\n",
      "01:042:027 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender\n",
      "           in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his\n",
      "           sack's mouth.\n",
      "01:042:028 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,\n",
      "           it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they\n",
      "           were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath\n",
      "           done unto us?\n",
      "01:042:029 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,\n",
      "           and told him all that befell unto them; saying,\n",
      "01:042:030 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and\n",
      "           took us for spies of the country.\n",
      "01:042:031 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:\n",
      "01:042:032 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the\n",
      "           youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "01:042:033 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby\n",
      "           shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren\n",
      "           here with me, and take food for the famine of your households,\n",
      "           and be gone:\n",
      "01:042:034 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know\n",
      "           that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I\n",
      "           deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.\n",
      "01:042:035 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,\n",
      "           every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both\n",
      "           they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were\n",
      "           afraid.\n",
      "01:042:036 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of\n",
      "           my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will\n",
      "           take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.\n",
      "01:042:037 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if\n",
      "           I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will\n",
      "           bring him to thee again.\n",
      "01:042:038 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his\n",
      "           brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him\n",
      "           by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my\n",
      "           gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "01:043:001 And the famine was sore in the land.\n",
      "01:043:002 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which\n",
      "           they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go\n",
      "           again, buy us a little food.\n",
      "01:043:003 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest\n",
      "           unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother\n",
      "           be with you.\n",
      "01:043:004 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy\n",
      "           thee food:\n",
      "01:043:005 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the\n",
      "           man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your\n",
      "           brother be with you.\n",
      "01:043:006 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell\n",
      "           the man whether ye had yet a brother?\n",
      "01:043:007 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of\n",
      "           our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another\n",
      "           brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these\n",
      "           words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your\n",
      "           brother down?\n",
      "01:043:008 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me,\n",
      "           and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both\n",
      "           we, and thou, and also our little ones.\n",
      "01:043:009 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him:\n",
      "           if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then\n",
      "           let me bear the blame for ever:\n",
      "01:043:010 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this\n",
      "           second time.\n",
      "01:043:011 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now,\n",
      "           do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,\n",
      "           and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little\n",
      "           honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:\n",
      "01:043:012 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was\n",
      "           brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in\n",
      "           your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:\n",
      "01:043:013 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:\n",
      "01:043:014 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may\n",

      "           of my children, I am bereaved.\n",
      "01:043:015 And the men took that present, and they took double money in\n",
      "           their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt,\n",
      "           and stood before Joseph.\n",
      "01:043:016 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler\n",
      "           of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready;\n",
      "           for these men shall dine with me at noon.\n",
      "01:043:017 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men\n",

      "01:043:018 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into\n",
      "           Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was\n",
      "           returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in;\n",
      "           that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and\n",
      "           take us for bondmen, and our asses.\n",
      "01:043:019 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they\n",
      "           communed with him at the door of the house,\n",
      "01:043:020 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy\n",
      "           food:\n",
      "01:043:021 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened\n",
      "           our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of\n",
      "           his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it\n",
      "           again in our hand.\n",
      "01:043:022 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:\n",
      "           we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.\n",
      "01:043:023 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God\n",
      "           of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had\n",
      "           your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.\n",
      "01:043:024 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them\n",
      "           water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses\n",
      "           provender.\n",
      "01:043:025 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:\n",
      "           for they heard that they should eat bread there.\n",
      "01:043:026 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which\n",
      "           was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him\n",
      "           to the earth.\n",
      "01:043:027 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father\n",
      "           well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?\n",
      "01:043:028 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health,\n",
      "           he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made\n",
      "           obeisance.\n",
      "01:043:029 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his\n",
      "           mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom\n",
      "           ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my\n",
      "           son.\n",
      "01:043:030 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his\n",
      "           brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his\n",
      "           chamber, and wept there.\n",
      "01:043:031 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself,\n",
      "           and said, Set on bread.\n",
      "01:043:032 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by\n",
      "           themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by\n",
      "           themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the\n",
      "           Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.\n",
      "01:043:033 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his\n",
      "           birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the\n",
      "           men marvelled one at another.\n",
      "01:043:034 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but\n",
      "           Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And\n",
      "           they drank, and were merry with him.\n",
      "01:044:001 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the\n",
      "           men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put\n",
      "           every man's money in his sack's mouth.\n",
      "01:044:002 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the\n",
      "           youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word\n",
      "           that Joseph had spoken.\n",
      "01:044:003 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they\n",
      "           and their asses.\n",
      "01:044:004 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,\n",
      "           Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and\n",
      "           when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye\n",
      "           rewarded evil for good?\n",
      "01:044:005 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed\n",
      "           he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.\n",
      "01:044:006 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.\n",
      "01:044:007 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?\n",
      "           God forbid that thy servants should do according to this\n",
      "           thing:\n",
      "01:044:008 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we\n",
      "           brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then\n",
      "           should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?\n",
      "01:044:009 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,\n",
      "           and we also will be my lord's bondmen.\n",
      "01:044:010 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he\n",
      "           with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be\n",
      "           blameless.\n",
      "01:044:011 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,\n",
      "           and opened every man his sack.\n",
      "01:044:012 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the\n",
      "           youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.\n",
      "01:044:013 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and\n",
      "           returned to the city.\n",
      "01:044:014 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was\n",
      "           yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.\n",
      "01:044:015 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have\n",
      "           done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?\n",
      "01:044:016 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we\n",
      "           speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the\n",
      "           iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants,\n",
      "           both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.\n",
      "01:044:017 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in\n",
      "           whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as\n",
      "           for you, get you up in peace unto your father.\n",
      "01:044:018 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy\n",
      "           servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let\n",
      "           not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as\n",
      "           Pharaoh.\n",
      "01:044:019 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a\n",
      "           brother?\n",
      "01:044:020 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a\n",
      "           child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead,\n",
      "           and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.\n",
      "01:044:021 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,\n",
      "           that I may set mine eyes upon him.\n",
      "01:044:022 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for\n",
      "           if he should leave his father, his father would die.\n",
      "01:044:023 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest\n",
      "           brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.\n",
      "01:044:024 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my\n",
      "           father, we told him the words of my lord.\n",
      "01:044:025 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.\n",
      "01:044:026 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be\n",
      "           with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's\n",
      "           face, except our youngest brother be with us.\n",
      "01:044:027 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife\n",
      "           bare me two sons:\n",
      "01:044:028 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in\n",
      "           pieces; and I saw him not since:\n",
      "01:044:029 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye\n",
      "           shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "01:044:030 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the\n",
      "           lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the\n",
      "           lad's life;\n",
      "01:044:031 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with\n",
      "           us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the\n",
      "           gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "01:044:032 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,\n",
      "           saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the\n",
      "           blame to my father for ever.\n",
      "01:044:033 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of\n",
      "           the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his\n",
      "           brethren.\n",
      "01:044:034 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with\n",
      "           me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my\n",
      "           father.\n",
      "01:045:001 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that\n",
      "           stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me.\n",
      "           And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself\n",
      "           known unto his brethren.\n",
      "01:045:002 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh\n",
      "           heard.\n",
      "01:045:003 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father\n",
      "           yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were\n",
      "           troubled at his presence.\n",
      "01:045:004 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray\n",
      "           you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your\n",
      "           brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.\n",
      "01:045:005 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that\n",
      "           ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve\n",
      "           life.\n",
      "01:045:006 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet\n",
      "           there are five years, in the which there shall neither be\n",
      "           earing nor harvest.\n",
      "01:045:007 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the\n",
      "           earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.\n",
      "01:045:008 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he\n",
      "           hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house,\n",
      "           and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:045:009 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith\n",
      "           thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down\n",
      "           unto me, tarry not:\n",
      "01:045:010 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be\n",
      "           near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's\n",
      "           children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou\n",
      "           hast:\n",
      "01:045:011 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of\n",
      "           famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast,\n",
      "           come to poverty.\n",
      "01:045:012 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother\n",
      "           Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.\n",
      "01:045:013 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of\n",
      "           all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my\n",
      "           father hither.\n",
      "01:045:014 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and\n",
      "           Benjamin wept upon his neck.\n",
      "01:045:015 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and\n",
      "           after that his brethren talked with him.\n",
      "01:045:016 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,\n",
      "           Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and\n",
      "           his servants.\n",
      "01:045:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do\n",
      "           ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;\n",
      "01:045:018 And take your father and your households, and come unto me:\n",
      "           and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye\n",
      "           shall eat the fat of the land.\n",
      "01:045:019 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the\n",
      "           land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and\n",
      "           bring your father, and come.\n",
      "01:045:020 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of\n",
      "           Egypt is your's.\n",
      "01:045:021 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them\n",
      "           wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them\n",
      "           provision for the way.\n",
      "01:045:022 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to\n",
      "           Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five\n",
      "           changes of raiment.\n",
      "01:045:023 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden\n",
      "           with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with\n",
      "           corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.\n",
      "01:045:024 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said\n",
      "           unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.\n",
      "01:045:025 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of\n",
      "           Canaan unto Jacob their father,\n",
      "01:045:026 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor\n",
      "           over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he\n",
      "           believed them not.\n",
      "01:045:027 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said\n",
      "           unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to\n",
      "           carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:\n",
      "01:045:028 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I\n",
      "           will go and see him before I die.\n",
      "01:046:001 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to\n",
      "           Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father\n",
      "           Isaac.\n",
      "01:046:002 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and\n",
      "           said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.\n",
      "01:046:003 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go\n",
      "           down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:\n",
      "01:046:004 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely\n",
      "           bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine\n",
      "           eyes.\n",
      "01:046:005 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel\n",
      "           carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their\n",
      "           wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.\n",
      "01:046:006 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had\n",
      "           gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and\n",
      "           all his seed with him:\n",
      "01:046:007 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his\n",
      "           sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into\n",
      "           Egypt.\n",
      "01:046:008 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came\n",
      "           into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.\n",
      "01:046:009 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and\n",
      "           Carmi.\n",
      "01:046:010 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and\n",
      "           Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.\n",
      "01:046:011 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.\n",

      "           prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.\n",
      "01:047:021 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end\n",
      "           of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.\n",
      "01:047:022 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests\n",

      "           the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.\n",
      "01:047:026 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,\n",

      "           do as thou hast said.\n",
      "01:047:031 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel\n",
      "           bowed himself upon the bed's head.\n",

      "           Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,\n",
      "           Manasseh and Ephraim.\n",
      "01:048:002 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh\n",
      "           unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the\n",
      "           bed.\n",
      "01:048:003 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at\n",
      "           Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,\n",
      "01:048:004 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and\n",

      "           and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an\n",
      "           everlasting possession.\n",
      "01:048:005 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born\n",
      "           unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into\n",
      "           Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.\n",
      "01:048:006 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be\n",
      "           thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in\n",
      "           their inheritance.\n",
      "01:048:007 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in\n",

      "           hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray\n",
      "           thee, unto me, and I will bless them.\n",
      "01:048:010 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not\n",
      "           see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them,\n",
      "           and embraced them.\n",
      "01:048:011 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy\n",
      "           face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.\n",
      "01:048:012 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he\n",
      "           bowed himself with his face to the earth.\n",
      "01:048:013 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward\n",
      "           Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward\n",
      "           Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.\n",
      "01:048:014 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon\n",
      "           Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon\n",
      "           Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was\n",
      "           the firstborn.\n",
      "01:048:015 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers\n",

      "           midst of the earth.\n",
      "01:048:017 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon\n",
      "           the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his\n",
      "           father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto\n",
      "           Manasseh's head.\n",
      "01:048:018 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this\n",

      "           he set Ephraim before Manasseh.\n",

      "it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or\n",
      "conversation?'\n",
      "\n",
      "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\n",
      "hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure\n",
      "of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n",
      "picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\n",
      "close by her.\n",

      "Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it\n",
      "occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time\n",
      "it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH\n",
      "OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,\n",
      "Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had\n",
      "never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch\n",
      "to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field\n",
      "after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large\n",
      "rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\n",
      "in the world she was to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\n",
      "dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\n",
      "about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep\n",
      "well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\n",
      "plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was\n",
      "going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what\n",
      "she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\n",
      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\n",
      "hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as\n",
      "she passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great\n",
      "disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\n",
      "of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as\n",
      "she fell past it.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well!' thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shall\n",
      "think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at\n",
      "home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top\n",
      "of the house!' (Which was very likely true.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! 'I wonder how\n",
      "many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud. 'I must be getting\n",
      "somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four\n",
      "thousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several\n",
      "things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this\n",
      "was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there\n",
      "was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)\n",
      "'--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\n",
      "or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or\n",
      "Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the\n",
      "earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with\n",
      "their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad\n",
      "there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the\n",
      "right word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country\n",
      "is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and\n",
      "she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\n",
      "through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) 'And what an\n",
      "ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to\n",
      "ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\n",
      "talking again. 'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'\n",
      "(Dinah was the cat.) 'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at\n",
      "tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no\n",
      "mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very\n",
      "like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice\n",
      "began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy\n",
      "sort of way, 'Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, 'Do\n",
      "bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,\n",
      "it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing\n",
      "off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with\n",
      "Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:\n",
      "did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon\n",
      "a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\n",
      "she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\n",
      "long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.\n",
      "There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and\n",
      "was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my ears\n",
      "and whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she\n",
      "turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\n",
      "from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\n",
      "Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\n",
      "door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\n",
      "get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\n",
      "glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's\n",
      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\n",
      "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\n",
      "into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\n",
      "that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\n",
      "those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\n",
      "doorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'it\n",
      "would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could\n",
      "shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.'\n",
      "For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,\n",
      "that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really\n",
      "impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\n",
      "back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\n",
      "any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\n",
      "time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not here\n",
      "before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\n",
      "label, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large\n",
      "letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was\n",
      "not going to do THAT in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and\n",
      "see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read several nice\n",
      "little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild\n",
      "beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember\n",
      "the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot\n",
      "poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\n",
      "finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never\n",
      "forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is\n",
      "almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste\n",
      "it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour\n",
      "of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot\n",
      "buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n",

      "telescope.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\n",
      "brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\n",
      "through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\n",
      "waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\n",
      "she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said\n",

      "ever having seen such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\n",
      "into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\n",
      "door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\n",
      "went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\n",
      "it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\n",
      "best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\n",
      "and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\n",
      "sat down and cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself,\n",
      "rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally\n",
      "gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\n",
      "and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\n",
      "her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\n",
      "cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\n",
      "for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n",
      "'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!\n",
      "Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\n",
      "she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n",
      "'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. 'Well, I'll eat it,' said\n",
      "Alice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\n",

      "\n",
      "She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way? Which\n",
      "way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\n",
      "growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\n",
      "size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\n",
      "had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\n",
      "things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on\n",
      "in the common way.\n",

      "\n",
      "As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\n",

      "she was talking. 'How CAN I have done that?' she thought. 'I must\n",
      "be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure\n",
      "herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now\n",
      "about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found\n",

      "it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\n",
      "sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'and\n",
      "now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed back to the little door:\n",
      "but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was\n",
      "lying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'\n",
      "thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!\n",
      "And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'\n",
      "\n",
      "As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!\n",
      "she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she\n",
      "had somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back by\n",
      "railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\n",
      "her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\n",
      "to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\n",
      "sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\n",
      "of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon\n",
      "made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she\n",
      "was nine feet high.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about, trying\n",
      "to find her way out. 'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\n",
      "being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!\n",
      "However, everything is queer to-day.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\n",
      "off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\n",
      "it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\n",
      "she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\n",
      "slipped in like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?\n",
      "Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\n",
      "likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.' So she\n",
      "began: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\n",
      "of swimming about here, O Mouse!' (Alice thought this must be the right\n",
      "way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\n",
      "she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--of\n",
      "a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather\n",
      "inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\n",
      "but it said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's\n",
      "a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all\n",
      "her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\n",
      "anything had happened.) So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?' which\n",
      "was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\n",
      "sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.\n",
      "'Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt\n",
      "the poor animal's feelings. 'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. 'Would\n",
      "YOU like cats if you were me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angry\n",
      "about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd\n",
      "take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet\n",
      "thing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the\n",
      "pool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and\n",
      "washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's\n",
      "such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried\n",
      "Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she\n",
      "felt certain it must be really offended. 'We won't talk about her any\n",
      "more if you'd rather not.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\n",
      "tail. 'As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED\n",
      "cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\n",
      "conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?' The Mouse did not\n",
      "answer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog near\n",
      "our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\n",
      "know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when\n",
      "you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\n",
      "of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,\n",
      "you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He\n",
      "says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a sorrowful\n",
      "tone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the Mouse was swimming\n",
      "away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in\n",
      "the pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\n",
      "won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' When the\n",
      "Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its\n",
      "face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\n",
      "trembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my\n",
      "history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\n",
      "birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,\n",
      "a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the\n",
      "way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\n",
      "\n",
      "They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the\n",
      "birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\n",
      "to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\n",
      "consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural\n",
      "to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had\n",
      "known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the\n",
      "Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older than\n",
      "you, and must know better'; and this Alice would not allow without\n",
      "knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its\n",
      "age, there was no more to be said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\n",
      "called out, 'Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL soon make you\n",
      "dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse\n",
      "in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt\n",
      "sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, 'are you all ready? This\n",
      "is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \"William\n",
      "the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\n",
      "to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\n",

      "\n",
      "'Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: 'Did\n",
      "you speak?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not I!' said the Lory hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. \"Edwin and Morcar,\n",
      "the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,\n",
      "the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Found WHAT?' said the Duck.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: 'of course you know what\n",
      "\"it\" means.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I know what \"it\" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said the\n",
      "Duck: 'it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\n",
      "archbishop find?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, '\"--found\n",
      "it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the\n",
      "crown. William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his\n",
      "Normans--\" How are you getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning\n",
      "to Alice as it spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "'As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: 'it doesn't seem to\n",
      "dry me at all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, 'I move\n",
      "that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\n",
      "remedies--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Speak English!' said the Eaglet. 'I don't know the meaning of half\n",
      "those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!' And\n",
      "the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\n",
      "tittered audibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, 'was, that\n",
      "the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,\n",
      "but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,\n",
      "and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why,' said the Dodo, 'the best way to explain it is to do it.' (And, as\n",
      "you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell\n",
      "you how the Dodo managed it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, ('the exact\n",
      "shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party were placed\n",
      "along the course, here and there. There was no 'One, two, three, and\n",
      "away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\n",
      "liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\n",
      "when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,\n",
      "the Dodo suddenly called out 'The race is over!' and they all crowded\n",
      "round it, panting, and asking, 'But who has won?'\n",
      "\n",
      "This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,\n",
      "and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead\n",
      "(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures\n",
      "of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,\n",
      "'EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;\n",
      "and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused\n",
      "way, 'Prizes! Prizes!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\n",
      "pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\n",
      "not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one\n",
      "a-piece all round.\n",
      "\n",
      "'But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. 'What else have you got in\n",
      "your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\n",
      "presented the thimble, saying 'We beg your acceptance of this elegant\n",
      "thimble'; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\n",
      "that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\n",
      "to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\n",
      "confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\n",
      "theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\n",
      "However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\n",
      "begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why\n",
      "it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\n",
      "would be offended again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\n",
      "sighing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with wonder at\n",
      "the Mouse's tail; 'but why do you call it sad?' And she kept on puzzling\n",
      "about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was\n",
      "something like this:--\n",

      "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\n",
      "anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\n",
      "it muttering to itself 'The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\n",
      "my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\n",
      "ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a\n",
      "moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,\n",
      "and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were\n",
      "nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in\n",
      "the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,\n",
      "had vanished completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\n",
      "called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing\n",
      "out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!\n",
      "Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once\n",
      "in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it\n",
      "had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How\n",
      "surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him\n",
      "his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.' As she said this, she\n",
      "came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\n",
      "plate with the name 'W. RABBIT' engraved upon it. She went in without\n",
      "knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\n",
      "real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\n",
      "fan and gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, 'to be going messages for\n",
      "a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!' And she\n",
      "began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '\"Miss Alice! Come\n",
      "here directly, and get ready for your walk!\" \"Coming in a minute,\n",
      "nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out.\" Only I don't\n",
      "think,' Alice went on, 'that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it\n",
      "began ordering people about like that!'\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\n",
      "in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs\n",
      "of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,\n",
      "and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little\n",
      "bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time\n",
      "with the words 'DRINK ME,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it\n",
      "to her lips. 'I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said\n",
      "to herself, 'whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what\n",
      "this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really\n",
      "I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'\n",
      "\n",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\n",
      "drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\n",
      "and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\n",
      "down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't\n",
      "grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't\n",
      "drunk quite so much!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\n",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\n",
      "of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself 'Now I\n",
      "can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\n",
      "and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\n",
      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, 'when one wasn't\n",
      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\n",
      "rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and\n",
      "yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n",
      "CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that\n",
      "kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!\n",
      "There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I\n",
      "grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a sorrowful\n",
      "tone; 'at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But then,' thought Alice, 'shall I NEVER get any older than I am\n",
      "now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but\n",
      "then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. 'How can you learn\n",
      "lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all\n",
      "for any lesson-books!'\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making\n",
      "quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard\n",
      "a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. 'Fetch me my gloves this moment!'\n",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\n",
      "the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large\n",
      "as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\n",
      "the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself 'Then I'll\n",
      "go round and get in at the window.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--'Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And\n",
      "then a voice she had never heard before, 'Sure then I'm here! Digging\n",
      "for apples, yer honour!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. 'Here! Come and\n",
      "help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it 'arrum.')\n",
      "\n",
      "'An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\n",
      "window!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\n",
      "now and then; such as, 'Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at\n",
      "all!' 'Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at last she spread out her\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n",
      "TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. 'What a number of\n",
      "cucumber-frames there must be!' thought Alice. 'I wonder what they'll do\n",
      "next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm\n",
      "sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\n",
      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices\n",
      "all talking together: she made out the words: 'Where's the other\n",
      "ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill!\n",
      "fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--No, tie 'em\n",
      "together first--they don't reach half high enough yet--Oh! they'll\n",
      "do well enough; don't be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this\n",
      "rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it's coming\n",
      "down! Heads below!' (a loud crash)--'Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I\n",
      "fancy--Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I\n",
      "won't, then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to\n",
      "go down the chimney!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said Alice to\n",
      "herself. 'Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in\n",
      "Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\n",
      "I THINK I can kick a little!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited\n",
      "till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)\n",
      "scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\n",
      "saying to herself 'This is Bill,' she gave one sharp kick, and waited to\n",
      "see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!'\n",
      "then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy\n",
      "now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\n",
      "us all about it!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, ('That's Bill,' thought\n",
      "Alice,) 'Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm better now--but I'm\n",
      "a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me\n",
      "like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'So you did, old fellow!' said the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called\n",
      "out as loud as she could, 'If you do. I'll set Dinah at you!'\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, 'I\n",
      "wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the\n",
      "roof off.' After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "Alice heard the Rabbit say, 'A barrowful will do, to begin with.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. 'I'll put a stop to this,'\n",
      "she said to herself, and shouted out, 'You'd better not do that again!'\n",
      "which produced another dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "head. 'If I eat one of these cakes,' she thought, 'it's sure to make\n",
      "SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must\n",
      "make me smaller, I suppose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through\n",
      "the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\n",
      "animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was\n",
      "in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered\n",
      "about in the wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the second\n",
      "thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be\n",
      "the best plan.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
      "great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 'Poor little thing!'\n",
      "said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but\n",
      "she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\n",
      "hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of\n",
      "all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and\n",
      "till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
      "leaves: 'I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that\n",
      "I've got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I\n",
      "suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\n",
      "question is, what?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\n",
      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\n",
      "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\n",
      "herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\n",
      "behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\n",
      "was on the top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\n",
      "mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,\n",
      "that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long\n",
      "hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.\n",

      "at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed\n",
      "her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\n",
      "rather shyly, 'I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know\n",

      "\n",

      "different sizes in a day is very confusing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; 'but when you\n",
      "have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then\n",
      "after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little\n",
      "queer, won't you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice; 'all I know\n",
      "is, it would feel very queer to ME.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. 'Who are YOU?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\n",
      "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY\n",
      "short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,\n",
      "you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\n",
      "good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant\n",

      "\n",
      "'No,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and\n",
      "perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some\n",
      "minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its\n",
      "arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think\n",

      "\n",

      "of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",
      "the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent\n",

      "\n",
      "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\n",
      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\n",
      "set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\n",
      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\n",
      "mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\n",

      "\n",
      "'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE my\n",

      "\n",
      "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she\n",
      "tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her\n",
      "neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had\n",
      "just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going\n",
      "to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops\n",
      "of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made\n",
      "her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and\n",
      "was beating her violently with its wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,\n",
      "and added with a kind of sob, 'I've tried every way, and nothing seems\n",
      "to suit them!'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried\n",
      "hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those\n",
      "serpents! There's no pleasing them!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\n",
      "saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "'As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon;\n",

      "'And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued the\n",
      "Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, 'and just as I was thinking I\n",
      "should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from\n",
      "the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. 'I'm a--I'm a--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. 'I can see you're trying to\n",
      "invent something!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\n",
      "the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\n",
      "contempt. 'I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE\n",
      "with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use\n",
      "denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an\n",
      "egg!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very truthful\n",
      "child; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\n",
      "know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; 'but if they do, why then they're\n",
      "a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\n",
      "minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're\n",
      "looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me\n",
      "whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking\n",
      "for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't\n",
      "like them raw.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\n",
      "down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as\n",
      "she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\n",
      "every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she\n",
      "remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and\n",
      "she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\n",
      "other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\n",
      "succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\n",
      "felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\n",
      "and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done\n",
      "now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going\n",
      "to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right\n",
      "size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that\n",
      "to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open\n",
      "place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives\n",
      "there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,\n",
      "I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the\n",
      "righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she\n",
      "had brought herself down to nine inches high.\n",

      "CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper\n",
      "\n",
      "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\n",
      "to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\n",
      "wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\n",
      "otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\n",
      "fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened\n",
      "by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\n",
      "frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all\n",
      "over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,\n",
      "and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\n",
      "nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\n",
      "saying, in a solemn tone, 'For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen\n",
      "to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,\n",
      "only changing the order of the words a little, 'From the Queen. An\n",
      "invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the\n",
      "wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\n",
      "Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\n",
      "door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, 'and that for\n",
      "two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you\n",
      "are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could\n",
      "possibly hear you.' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise\n",
      "going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then\n",
      "a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Please, then,' said Alice, 'how am I to get in?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on\n",
      "without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance,\n",
      "if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'\n",
      "He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this\n",
      "Alice thought decidedly uncivil. 'But perhaps he can't help it,' she\n",
      "said to herself; 'his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.\n",
      "But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she\n",
      "repeated, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--'\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\n",
      "skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,\n",
      "and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "'--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\n",
      "as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "'How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. 'That's the first\n",
      "question, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. 'It's really\n",
      "dreadful,' she muttered to herself, 'the way all the creatures argue.\n",
      "It's enough to drive one crazy!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\n",
      "remark, with variations. 'I shall sit here,' he said, 'on and off, for\n",
      "days and days.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But what am I to do?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's\n",
      "perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\n",
      "one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in\n",
      "the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring\n",
      "a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to herself,\n",
      "as well as she could for sneezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess\n",
      "sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\n",
      "alternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen\n",
      "that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on\n",
      "the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\n",
      "not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, 'why\n",
      "your cat grins like that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, 'and that's why. Pig!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\n",
      "jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,\n",
      "and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "'I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know\n",
      "that cats COULD grin.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'They all can,' said the Duchess; 'and most of 'em do.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite\n",
      "pleased to have got into a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You don't know much,' said the Duchess; 'and that's a fact.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\n",
      "be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\n",
      "was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\n",
      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\n",
      "the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up and down in\n",
      "an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually\n",
      "large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "'If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a hoarse\n",
      "growl, 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get\n",
      "an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. 'Just think of\n",
      "what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes\n",
      "twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, 'chop off her head!'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\n",
      "the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\n",
      "be listening, so she went on again: 'Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is\n",
      "it twelve? I--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; 'I never could abide figures!'\n",
      "And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of\n",
      "lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of\n",
      "every line:\n",
      "\n",
      "   'Speak roughly to your little boy,\n",
      "    And beat him when he sneezes:\n",

      "\n",
      "         CHORUS.\n",
      "\n",
      " (In which the cook and the baby joined):--\n",

      "\n",
      "While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\n",
      "the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\n",
      "that Alice could hardly hear the words:--\n",
      "\n",
      "   'I speak severely to my boy,\n",
      "    I beat him when he sneezes;\n",

      "flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play\n",

      "a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\n",
      "little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just\n",
      "like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting\n",
      "like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and\n",

      "it out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,'\n",
      "thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be\n",
      "murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the\n",
      "little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n",
      "'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing\n",
      "yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to\n",
      "see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\n",
      "a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its\n",
      "eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not\n",
      "like the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,'\n",
      "she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, there were no tears. 'If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'\n",
      "said Alice, seriously, 'I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\n",
      "now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\n",
      "to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, 'Now, what am I to do with\n",
      "this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted again, so violently,\n",
      "that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could\n",
      "be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she\n",
      "felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see\n",
      "it trot away quietly into the wood. 'If it had grown up,' she said\n",
      "to herself, 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\n",
      "rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began thinking over other\n",
      "children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\n",
      "to herself, 'if one only knew the right way to change them--' when she\n",
      "was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a\n",
      "tree a few yards off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\n",
      "thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she\n",
      "felt that it ought to be treated with respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\n",
      "whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.\n",
      "'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on. 'Would you\n",
      "tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't much care where--' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long\n",
      "enough.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.\n",
      "'What sort of people live about here?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round, 'lives\n",
      "a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw, 'lives a March\n",
      "Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: 'we're all mad here. I'm mad.\n",
      "You're mad.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You must be,' said the Cat, 'or you wouldn't have come here.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on 'And how\n",
      "do you know that you're mad?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'To begin with,' said the Cat, 'a dog's not mad. You grant that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I suppose so,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, then,' the Cat went on, 'you see, a dog growls when it's angry,\n",
      "and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and\n",
      "wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Call it what you like,' said the Cat. 'Do you play croquet with the\n",
      "Queen to-day?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I should like it very much,' said Alice, 'but I haven't been invited\n",
      "yet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\n",
      "things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\n",
      "it suddenly appeared again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. 'I'd nearly\n",
      "forgotten to ask.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\n",
      "in a natural way.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\n",
      "appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\n",
      "which the March Hare was said to live. 'I've seen hatters before,' she\n",
      "said to herself; 'the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\n",
      "perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as\n",
      "it was in March.' As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\n",
      "again, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I said pig,' replied Alice; 'and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and\n",
      "vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\n",
      "beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\n",
      "remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin\n",
      "without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house\n",
      "of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\n",
      "chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\n",
      "was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\n",
      "nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to\n",
      "about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,\n",
      "saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost\n",

      "CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\n",
      "March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\n",
      "between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\n",
      "cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. 'Very\n",
      "uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only, as it's asleep, I\n",
      "suppose it doesn't mind.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\n",
      "one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw Alice\n",
      "coming. 'There's PLENTY of room!' said Alice indignantly, and she sat\n",
      "down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n",
      "'I don't see any wine,' she remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'There isn't any,' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,' said\n",
      "the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; 'it's laid for a great\n",
      "many more than three.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice\n",
      "for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said with some\n",
      "severity; 'it's very rude.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID\n",
      "was, 'Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they've\n",
      "begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she added aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?' said the\n",
      "March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Exactly so,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I\n",
      "say--that's the same thing, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. 'You might just as well say\n",
      "that \"I see what I eat\" is the same thing as \"I eat what I see\"!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that \"I like what I\n",
      "get\" is the same thing as \"I get what I like\"!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\n",
      "talking in his sleep, 'that \"I breathe when I sleep\" is the same thing\n",
      "as \"I sleep when I breathe\"!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the\n",
      "conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice\n",
      "thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,\n",
      "which wasn't much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month\n",
      "is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\n",
      "pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\n",
      "and holding it to his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice considered a little, and then said 'The fourth.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. 'I told you butter wouldn't suit\n",
      "the works!' he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter grumbled:\n",
      "'you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\n",
      "it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\n",
      "nothing better to say than his first remark, 'It was the BEST butter,\n",
      "you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 'What a\n",
      "funny watch!' she remarked. 'It tells the day of the month, and doesn't\n",
      "tell what o'clock it is!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. 'Does YOUR watch tell you what\n",
      "year it is?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: 'but that's because it\n",
      "stays the same year for such a long time together.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no\n",
      "sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 'I don't quite\n",
      "understand you,' she said, as politely as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured a little\n",
      "hot tea upon its nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\n",
      "eyes, 'Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to Alice\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, I give it up,' Alice replied: 'what's the answer?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Nor I,' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the\n",
      "time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk\n",
      "about wasting IT. It's HIM.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.\n",
      "'I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time\n",
      "when I learn music.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. 'He won't stand beating.\n",
      "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything\n",
      "you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in\n",
      "the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a\n",
      "hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\n",
      "time for dinner!'\n",
      "\n",
      "('I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n",
      "\n",
      "'That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully: 'but then--I\n",
      "shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: 'but you could keep it to\n",
      "half-past one as long as you liked.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter shook his head mournfully. 'Not I!' he replied. 'We\n",
      "quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--' (pointing\n",
      "with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) '--it was at the great concert\n",
      "given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\n",
      "     How I wonder what you're at!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You know the song, perhaps?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've heard something like it,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--\n",
      "\n",
      "     \"Up above the world you fly,\n",
      "     Like a tea-tray in the sky.\n",
      "         Twinkle, twinkle--\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 'Twinkle,\n",
      "twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that they had to pinch\n",
      "it to make it stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter, 'when the\n",
      "Queen jumped up and bawled out, \"He's murdering the time! Off with his\n",
      "head!\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't\n",
      "do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'\n",
      "\n",
      "A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is that the reason so many\n",
      "tea-things are put out here?' she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time,\n",
      "and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice ventured\n",
      "to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n",
      "'I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at the\n",
      "proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. 'Wake up, Dormouse!' And\n",
      "they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. 'I wasn't asleep,' he said in a\n",
      "hoarse, feeble voice: 'I heard every word you fellows were saying.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again\n",
      "before it's done.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the Dormouse began\n",
      "in a great hurry; 'and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\n",
      "they lived at the bottom of a well--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great interest in\n",
      "questions of eating and drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "'They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\n",
      "two.\n",
      "\n",
      "'They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently remarked; 'they'd\n",
      "have been ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'So they were,' said the Dormouse; 'VERY ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\n",
      "living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: 'But\n",
      "why did they live at the bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, 'so I can't\n",
      "take more.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: 'it's very easy to take\n",
      "MORE than nothing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself\n",
      "to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\n",
      "repeated her question. 'Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\n",
      "said, 'It was a treacle-well.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\n",
      "Hatter and the March Hare went 'Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse sulkily\n",
      "remarked, 'If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for\n",
      "yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; 'I won't interrupt again. I\n",
      "dare say there may be ONE.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\n",
      "go on. 'And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,\n",
      "you know--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: 'let's all move one place\n",
      "on.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\n",

      "moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\n",
      "out 'The Queen! The Queen!' and the three gardeners instantly threw\n",
      "themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\n",

      "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like\n",
      "the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\n",
      "corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\n",
      "diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\n",
      "the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\n",
      "jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented\n",
      "with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among\n",
      "them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried\n",
      "nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\n",
      "noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's\n",
      "crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand\n",

      "\n",

      "a procession,' thought she, 'if people had all to lie down upon their\n",

      "\n",
      "'And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who\n",

      "faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the\n",

      "courtiers, or three of her own children.\n",

      "silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 'Consider, my\n",

      "\n",
      "'Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. 'You make me giddy.' And then,\n",

      "to Alice for protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a large\n",
      "flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\n",
      "minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\n",
      "others.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Yes!' shouted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\n",
      "wondering very much what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side. She was\n",
      "walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Very,' said Alice: '--where's the Duchess?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\n",
      "anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\n",
      "tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered 'She's under\n",
      "sentence of execution.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What for?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Did you say \"What a pity!\"?' the Rabbit asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity. I said\n",
      "\"What for?\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\n",
      "scream of laughter. 'Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\n",
      "tone. 'The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\n",
      "Queen said--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\n",
      "people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\n",
      "other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\n",
      "began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in\n",
      "her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,\n",
      "the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves\n",
      "up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\n",
      "she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under\n",
      "her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got\n",
      "its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a\n",
      "blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,\n",
      "with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out\n",
      "laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin\n",
      "again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\n",
      "itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was\n",
      "generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the\n",
      "hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up\n",
      "and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the\n",
      "conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\n",
      "all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short\n",
      "time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\n",
      "shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her head!' about once in a\n",
      "minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\n",
      "dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n",
      "'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me? They're dreadfully\n",
      "fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one\n",
      "left alive!'\n",
      "\n",
      "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\n",
      "could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance\n",
      "in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it\n",
      "a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself\n",
      "'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\n",
      "enough for it to speak with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. 'It's no use\n",
      "speaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one\n",
      "of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\n",
      "down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\n",
      "she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was\n",
      "enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a\n",
      "complaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear\n",
      "oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;\n",
      "at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how\n",
      "confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the\n",
      "arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\n",
      "ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only\n",
      "it ran away when it saw mine coming!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed\n",
      "that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n",
      "'--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen smiled and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and looking\n",
      "at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to\n",
      "introduce it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may\n",
      "kiss my hand if it likes.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!'\n",
      "He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book,\n",
      "but I don't remember where.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called\n",
      "the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would\n",
      "have this cat removed!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.\n",
      "'Off with his head!' she said, without even looking round.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he\n",
      "hurried off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\n",
      "on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with\n",
      "passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\n",
      "executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\n",
      "of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\n",
      "whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\n",
      "to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\n",
      "other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the\n",
      "other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless\n",
      "sort of way to fly up into a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\n",
      "was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't\n",
      "matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side\n",
      "of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\n",
      "escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a\n",
      "large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\n",
      "the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\n",
      "while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\n",
      "the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\n",
      "all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\n",
      "what they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless\n",
      "there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\n",
      "thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be\n",
      "beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less\n",
      "than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last\n",
      "remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)\n",

      "And the executioner went off like an arrow.\n",

      " The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,\n",
      "by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely\n",

      "\n",
      "She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\n",
      "startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 'You're thinking\n",
      "about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't\n",
      "tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\n",
      "a bit.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. 'Everything's got a moral, if only\n",
      "you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as\n",
      "she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\n",
      "Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\n",
      "right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an\n",
      "uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\n",
      "bore it as well as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up\n",
      "the conversation a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "''Tis so,' said the Duchess: 'and the moral of that is--\"Oh, 'tis love,\n",
      "'tis love, that makes the world go round!\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding\n",
      "their own business!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her\n",
      "sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, 'and the moral\n",
      "of THAT is--\"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\n",
      "themselves.\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,'\n",
      "the Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about\n",
      "the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to\n",
      "have the experiment tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\n",
      "the moral of that is--\"Birds of a feather flock together.\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of\n",
      "putting things!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\n",
      "everything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here. And\n",
      "the moral of that is--\"The more there is of mine, the less there is of\n",
      "yours.\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,\n",
      "'it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; 'and the moral of that\n",
      "is--\"Be what you would seem to be\"--or if you'd like it put more\n",
      "simply--\"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\n",
      "appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise\n",
      "than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if\n",
      "I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in\n",
      "a pleased tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said\n",
      "Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. 'I make you a present\n",
      "of everything I've said as yet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. 'I'm glad they don't give\n",
      "birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to say it out\n",
      "loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\n",
      "little chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\n",
      "feel a little worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and\n",
      "the m--'\n",
      "\n",
      "But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even\n",
      "in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked\n",
      "into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen\n",
      "in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.\n",
      "\n",
      "'A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the\n",
      "ground as she spoke; 'either you or your head must be off, and that in\n",
      "about half no time! Take your choice!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was\n",
      "too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\n",
      "croquet-ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were\n",
      "resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\n",
      "back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would\n",
      "cost them their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with\n",
      "the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her\n",
      "head!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,\n",
      "who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by\n",
      "the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the\n",
      "players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and\n",
      "under sentence of execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have\n",
      "you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No,' said Alice. 'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\n",
      "to the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.' 'Come, THAT'S a good\n",
      "thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\n",
      "number of executions the Queen had ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.\n",
      "(IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy\n",
      "thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock\n",
      "Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\n",
      "executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with\n",
      "the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on\n",
      "the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go\n",
      "after that savage Queen: so she waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\n",
      "she was out of sight: then it chuckled. 'What fun!' said the Gryphon,\n",
      "half to itself, half to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'What IS the fun?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. 'It's all her fancy, that: they never\n",
      "executes nobody, you know. Come on!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly\n",
      "after it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\n",
      "sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\n",
      "nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\n",
      "pitied him deeply. 'What is his sorrow?' she asked the Gryphon, and the\n",
      "Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his\n",
      "fancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!'\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\n",
      "full of tears, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your\n",
      "history, she do.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit\n",
      "down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.' But\n",
      "she waited patiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real\n",
      "Turtle.'\n",
      "\n",
      "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\n",
      "occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant\n",
      "heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\n",
      "saying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could\n",
      "not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\n",
      "though still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the\n",
      "sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle\n",
      "angrily: 'really you are very dull!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,'\n",
      "added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor\n",
      "Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said\n",
      "to the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'\n",
      "and he went on in these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\n",
      "The Mock Turtle went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; 'you needn't be so proud\n",
      "as all that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Alice, 'we learned French and music.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in\n",
      "a tone of great relief. 'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,\n",
      "\"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of\n",
      "the sea.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. 'I\n",
      "only took the regular course.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What was that?' inquired Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle\n",
      "replied; 'and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,\n",
      "Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never heard of \"Uglification,\"' Alice ventured to say. 'What is it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. 'What! Never heard of\n",
      "uglifying!' it exclaimed. 'You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,\n",
      "you ARE a simpleton.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she\n",
      "turned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off\n",
      "the subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with\n",
      "Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\n",
      "that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\n",
      "Fainting in Coils.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What was THAT like?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too\n",
      "stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.\n",
      "He was an old crab, HE was.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught\n",
      "Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\n",
      "creatures hid their faces in their paws.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to\n",
      "change the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so\n",
      "on.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked:\n",
      "'because they lessen from day to day.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\n",
      "before she made her next remark. 'Then the eleventh day must have been a\n",
      "holiday?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided\n",

      "CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\n",
      "his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\n",
      "two sobs choked his voice. 'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,'\n",
      "said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\n",
      "the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\n",
      "running down his cheeks, he went on again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "'You may not have lived much under the sea--' ('I haven't,' said\n",
      "Alice)--'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'\n",
      "(Alice began to say 'I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily, and\n",
      "said 'No, never') '--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\n",
      "Lobster Quadrille is!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'No, indeed,' said Alice. 'What sort of a dance is it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why,' said the Gryphon, 'you first form into a line along the\n",
      "sea-shore--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. 'Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\n",
      "then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'--you advance twice--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, 'you throw the--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "'--as far out to sea as you can--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the Mock\n",
      "Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been\n",
      "jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly\n",
      "and quietly, and looked at Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Very much indeed,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.\n",
      "'We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. 'I've forgotten the words.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\n",
      "then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\n",
      "forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\n",
      "and sadly:--\n",
      "\n",
      " '\"Will you walk a little faster?\" said a whiting to a snail.\n",
      " \"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.\n",

      "\n",
      " \"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\n",
      " When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\"\n",
      " But the snail replied \"Too far, too far!\" and gave a look askance--\n",
      " Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\n",
      "\n",
      " Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\n",
      " Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\n",
      "\n",
      " '\"What matters it how far we go?\" his scaly friend replied.\n",
      " \"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\n",

      " Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\n",
      "\n",
      " Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?\n",
      " Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said Alice, feeling\n",

      "about the whiting!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, 'they--you've seen them,\n",
      "of course?'\n",

      "\n",
      "'You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle: 'crumbs would all\n",
      "wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the\n",
      "reason is--' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--'Tell her\n",
      "about the reason and all that,' he said to the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "'The reason is,' said the Gryphon, 'that they WOULD go with the lobsters\n",
      "to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long\n",
      "way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get\n",
      "them out again. That's all.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Thank you,' said Alice, 'it's very interesting. I never knew so much\n",
      "about a whiting before.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the Gryphon. 'Do you\n",
      "know why it's called a whiting?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I never thought about it,' said Alice. 'Why?'\n",
      "\n",
      "'IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated\n",
      "in a wondering tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. 'I mean, what\n",
      "makes them so shiny?'\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\n",
      "answer. 'They're done with blacking, I believe.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n",
      "'are done with a whiting. Now you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n",
      "'any shrimp could have told you that.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running\n",
      "on the song, 'I'd have said to the porpoise, \"Keep back, please: we\n",
      "don't want YOU with us!\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle said: 'no\n",
      "wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: 'why, if a fish came to ME, and\n",
      "told me he was going a journey, I should say \"With what porpoise?\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't you mean \"purpose\"?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\n",
      "the Gryphon added 'Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,' said\n",
      "Alice a little timidly: 'but it's no use going back to yesterday,\n",

      "\n",
      "'Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.\n",

      "'No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n",
      "'explanations take such a dreadful time.'\n",
      "\n",
      "So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\n",
      "saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\n",
      "the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\n",
      "their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went\n",
      "on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about\n",
      "her repeating 'YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the\n",
      "words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath,\n",

      "\n",
      "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\n",
      "arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little\n",
      "birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\n",
      "standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\n",
      "him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,\n",
      "and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court\n",
      "was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,\n",
      "that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the\n",
      "trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there\n",
      "seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about\n",
      "her, to pass away the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\n",
      "about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\n",
      "the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to\n",
      "herself, 'because of his great wig.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\n",
      "wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did\n",
      "not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,'\n",
      "(she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were\n",
      "animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said\n",
      "this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of\n",
      "it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her\n",
      "age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done\n",
      "just as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they\n",
      "doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. 'They can't have anything to put\n",
      "down yet, before the trial's begun.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for\n",
      "fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped\n",
      "hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the\n",
      "King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who\n",
      "was talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\n",
      "that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,\n",
      "and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell\n",
      "'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice\n",
      "muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\n",
      "could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\n",
      "very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\n",
      "that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\n",
      "at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was\n",
      "obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was\n",
      "of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\n",
      "unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--\n",
      "\n",
      "   'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n",
      "      All on a summer day:\n",
      "    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n",
      "      And took them quite away!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great\n",
      "deal to come before that!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three\n",
      "blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'\n",
      "\n",
      "The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one\n",
      "hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your\n",
      "Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished\n",
      "my tea when I was sent for.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\n",
      "court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it\n",
      "was,' he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\n",
      "wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\n",
      "reduced the answer to shillings and pence.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a\n",
      "memorandum of the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation; 'I've none of\n",
      "my own. I'm a hatter.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\n",
      "who turned pale and fidgeted.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Give your evidence,' said the King; 'and don't be nervous, or I'll have\n",
      "you executed on the spot.'\n",
      "\n",
      "This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\n",
      "from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in\n",
      "his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\n",
      "bread-and-butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\n",
      "her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\n",
      "grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\n",
      "the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as\n",
      "long as there was room for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting\n",
      "next to her. 'I can hardly breathe.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: 'I'm growing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing\n",
      "too.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that\n",
      "ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the\n",
      "other side of the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\n",
      "just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\n",
      "of the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!' on\n",
      "which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you\n",
      "executed, whether you're nervous or not.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n",
      "'--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the\n",
      "bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'The twinkling of the what?' said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply. 'Do you\n",
      "take me for a dunce? Go on!'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after\n",
      "that--only the March Hare said--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You did!' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'I deny it!' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking\n",
      "anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\n",
      "nothing, being fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'\n",
      "\n",
      "'But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\n",
      "down on one knee. 'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\n",
      "the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\n",
      "explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\n",
      "up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\n",
      "head first, and then sat upon it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read\n",
      "in the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some attempts\n",
      "at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\n",
      "court,\" and I never understood what it meant till now.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. 'Now we shall get\n",
      "on better.'\n",
      "\n",
      "'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the\n",
      "Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n",
      "\n",
      "'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\n",
      "without even waiting to put his shoes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "'--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the\n",

      "this was her dream:--\n",
      "\n",
      "First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\n",
      "hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking\n",
      "up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that\n",
      "queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that\n",
      "WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to\n",
      "listen, the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of\n",
      "her little sister's dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the\n",
      "frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she\n",
      "could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\n",
      "shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\n",
      "ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby\n",
      "was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed\n",
      "around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\n",
      "Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\n",
      "filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\n",
      "Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\n",
      "Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\n",
      "would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the\n",
      "wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling\n",
      "teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill\n",
      "cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the\n",
      "shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she\n",
      "knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing\n",
      "of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's\n",
      "heavy sobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\n",

nor did Alice think it soVERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear!\",\n 'Oh dear!',\n \"I shall be late!'\",\n '(when she thought it over afterwards, itoccurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the timeit all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCHOUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she hadnever before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watchto take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the fieldafter it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a largerabbit-hole under the hedge.',\n 'In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering howin the world she was to get out again.',\n 'The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and thendipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to thinkabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deepwell.',\n 'Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she hadplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what wasgoing to happen next.',\n 'First, she tried to look down and make out whatshe was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then shelooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled withcupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictureshung upon pegs.',\n \"She took down a jar from one of the shelves asshe passed; it was labelled 'ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her greatdisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fearof killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards asshe fell past it.\",\n \"'Well!'\",\n \"thought Alice to herself, 'after such a fall as this, I shallthink nothing of tumbling down stairs!\",\n \"How brave they'll all think me athome!\",\n \"Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the topof the house!'\",\n '(Which was very likely true.)',\n 'Down, down, down.',\n 'Would the fall NEVER come to an end!',\n \"'I wonder howmany miles I've fallen by this time?'\",\n 'she said aloud.',\n \"'I must be gettingsomewhere near the centre of the earth.\",\n \"Let me see: that would be fourthousand miles down, I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt severalthings of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though thiswas not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as therewas no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)'--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitudeor Longitude I've got to?'\",\n '(Alice had no idea what Latitude was, orLongitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)',\n 'Presently she began again.',\n \"'I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH theearth!\",\n \"How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk withtheir heads downward!\",\n \"The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather gladthere WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all theright word) '--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the countryis, you know.\",\n \"Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?'\",\n \"(andshe tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're fallingthrough the air!\",\n 'Do you think you could manage it?)',\n \"'And what anignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!\",\n \"No, it'll never do toask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\",\n 'Down, down, down.',\n 'There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon begantalking again.',\n \"'Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'\",\n '(Dinah was the cat.)',\n \"'I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk attea-time.\",\n 'Dinah my dear!',\n 'I wish you were down here with me!',\n \"There are nomice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's verylike a mouse, you know.\",\n \"But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'\",\n \"And here Alicebegan to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamysort of way, 'Do cats eat bats?\",\n \"Do cats eat bats?'\",\n \"and sometimes, 'Dobats eat cats?'\",\n \"for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question,it didn't much matter which way she put it.\",\n \"She felt that she was dozingoff, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand withDinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:did you ever eat a bat?'\",\n 'when suddenly, thump!',\n 'thump!',\n 'down she came upona heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.',\n 'Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was anotherlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.',\n \"There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, andwas just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, 'Oh my earsand whiskers, how late it's getting!'\",\n 'She was close behind it when sheturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she foundherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hangingfrom the roof.',\n 'There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and whenAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying everydoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever toget out again.',\n \"Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solidglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice'sfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;but, alas!\",\n 'either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,but at any rate it would not open any of them.',\n 'However, on the secondtime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, andbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried thelittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!',\n 'Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, notmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passageinto the loveliest garden you ever saw.',\n \"How she longed to get out ofthat dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers andthose cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through thedoorway; 'and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, 'itwould be of very little use without my shoulders.\",\n 'Oh, how I wish I couldshut up like a telescope!',\n \"I think I could, if I only know how to begin.'\",\n 'For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were reallyimpossible.',\n \"There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she wentback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or atany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: thistime she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly was not herebefore,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paperlabel, with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in largeletters.\",\n \"It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice wasnot going to do THAT in a hurry.\",\n '\\'No, I\\'ll look first,\\' she said, \\'andsee whether it\\'s marked \"poison\" or not\\'; for she had read several nicelittle histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wildbeasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not rememberthe simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hotpoker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut yourfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had neverforgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \\'poison,\\' it isalmost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.',\n \"However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to tasteit, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavourof cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hotbuttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\",\n \"*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *  *    *    *    *    *    *    *'What a curious feeling!'\",\n \"said Alice; 'I must be shutting up like atelescope.'\",\n 'And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her facebrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for goingthrough the little door into that lovely garden.',\n \"First, however, shewaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:she felt a little nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' saidAlice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a candle.\",\n \"I wonderwhat I should be like then?'\",\n 'And she tried to fancy what the flame of acandle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not rememberever having seen such a thing.',\n 'After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on goinginto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!',\n 'when she got to thedoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when shewent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reachit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried herbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thingsat down and cried.',\n \"'Come, there's no use in crying like that!'\",\n \"said Alice to herself,rather sharply; 'I advise you to leave off this minute!'\",\n 'She generallygave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears intoher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for havingcheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.',\n \"'But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, 'to pretend to be two people!\",\n \"Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!'\",\n \"Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\",\n \"'Well, I'll eat it,' saidAlice, 'and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if itmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'llget into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'\",\n \"She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, 'Which way?\",\n 'Whichway?',\n \"', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it wasgrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the samesize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alicehad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-waythings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go onin the common way.\",\n 'So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.',\n '*    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *  *    *    *    *    *    *    *CHAPTER II.',\n \"The Pool of Tears'Curiouser and curiouser!'\",\n \"cried Alice (she was so much surprised, thatfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); 'now I'mopening out like the largest telescope that ever was!\",\n \"Good-bye, feet!'\",\n '(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out ofsight, they were getting so far off).',\n \"'Oh, my poor little feet, I wonderwho will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?\",\n \"I'm sure_I_ shan't be able!\",\n \"I shall be a great deal too far off to troublemyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;--but I must bekind to them,' thought Alice, 'or perhaps they won't walk the way I wantto go!\",\n \"Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'\",\n 'And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.',\n \"'They mustgo by the carrier,' she thought; 'and how funny it'll seem, sendingpresents to one's own feet!\",\n 'And how odd the directions will look!',\n \"ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\",\n \"HEARTHRUG,         NEAR THE FENDER,           (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).\",\n \"Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'\",\n 'Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she wasnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little goldenkey and hurried off to the garden door.',\n 'Poor Alice!',\n 'It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, tolook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was morehopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.',\n \"'You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, 'a great girl likeyou,' (she might well say this), 'to go on crying in this way!\",\n \"Stop thismoment, I tell you!'\",\n 'But she went on all the same, shedding gallons oftears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inchesdeep and reaching half down the hall.',\n 'After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, andshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.',\n \"It was the WhiteRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves inone hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a greathurry, muttering to himself as he came, 'Oh!\",\n 'the Duchess, the Duchess!',\n 'Oh!',\n \"won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!'\",\n \"Alice felt sodesperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbitcame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--'The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\",\n \"Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, shekept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: 'Dear, dear!\",\n 'Howqueer everything is to-day!',\n 'And yesterday things went on just as usual.',\n \"I wonder if I've been changed in the night?\",\n 'Let me think: was I thesame when I got up this morning?',\n 'I almost think I can remember feeling alittle different.',\n \"But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Whoin the world am I?\",\n \"Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'\",\n 'And she began thinkingover all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, tosee if she could have been changed for any of them.',\n \"'I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, 'for her hair goes in such longringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can'tbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh!\",\n 'she knows such avery little!',\n \"Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I, and--oh dear, how puzzlingit all is!\",\n \"I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.\",\n 'Let mesee: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, andfour times seven is--oh dear!',\n 'I shall never get to twenty at that rate!',\n \"However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.\",\n \"London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, andRome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!\",\n 'I must have been changed forMabel!',\n 'I\\'ll try and say \"How doth the little--\"\\' and she crossed herhands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it,but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come thesame as they used to do:--     \\'How doth the little crocodile      Improve his shining tail,     And pour the waters of the Nile      On every golden scale!',\n \"'How cheerfully he seems to grin,      How neatly spread his claws,     And welcome little fishes in      With gently smiling jaws!'\",\n \"'I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her eyesfilled with tears again as she went on, 'I must be Mabel after all, andI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next tono toys to play with, and oh!\",\n 'ever so many lessons to learn!',\n \"No, I'vemade up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here!\",\n 'It\\'ll be nouse their putting their heads down and saying \"Come up again, dear!\"',\n 'Ishall only look up and say \"Who am I then?',\n 'Tell me that first, and then,if I like being that person, I\\'ll come up: if not, I\\'ll stay down heretill I\\'m somebody else\"--but, oh dear!\\'',\n \"cried Alice, with a sudden burstof tears, 'I do wish they WOULD put their heads down!\",\n \"I am so VERY tiredof being all alone here!'\",\n \"As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to seethat she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves whileshe was talking.\",\n \"'How CAN I have done that?'\",\n 'she thought.',\n \"'I mustbe growing small again.'\",\n 'She got up and went to the table to measureherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was nowabout two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon foundout that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she droppedit hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.',\n \"'That WAS a narrow escape!'\",\n \"said Alice, a good deal frightened at thesudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; 'andnow for the garden!'\",\n 'and she ran with all speed back to the little door:but, alas!',\n \"the little door was shut again, and the little golden key waslying on the glass table as before, 'and things are worse than ever,'thought the poor child, 'for I never was so small as this before, never!\",\n \"And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'\",\n 'As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!',\n 'she was up to her chin in salt water.',\n \"Her first idea was that shehad somehow fallen into the sea, 'and in that case I can go back byrailway,' she said to herself.\",\n '(Alice had been to the seaside once inher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you goto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in thesea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a rowof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.)',\n 'However, she soonmade out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when shewas nine feet high.',\n \"'I wish I hadn't cried so much!'\",\n 'said Alice, as she swam about, tryingto find her way out.',\n \"'I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, bybeing drowned in my own tears!\",\n 'That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!',\n \"However, everything is queer to-day.'\",\n 'Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little wayoff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thoughtit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how smallshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that hadslipped in like herself.',\n \"'Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, 'to speak to this mouse?\",\n \"Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think verylikely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.'\",\n \"So shebegan: 'O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool?\",\n \"I am very tiredof swimming about here, O Mouse!'\",\n \"(Alice thought this must be the rightway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, butshe remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, 'A mouse--ofa mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!')\",\n 'The Mouse looked at her ratherinquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,but it said nothing.',\n \"'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it'sa French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.'\",\n '(For, with allher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long agoanything had happened.)',\n \"So she began again: 'Ou est ma chatte?'\",\n 'whichwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book.',\n 'The Mouse gave asudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.',\n \"'Oh, I beg your pardon!'\",\n \"cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurtthe poor animal's feelings.\",\n \"'I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'\",\n \"'Not like cats!'\",\n 'cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.',\n \"'WouldYOU like cats if you were me?'\",\n \"'Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: 'don't be angryabout it.\",\n \"And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'dtake a fancy to cats if you could only see her.\",\n \"She is such a dear quietthing,' Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in thepool, 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws andwashing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she'ssuch a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!'\",\n 'criedAlice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and shefelt certain it must be really offended.',\n \"'We won't talk about her anymore if you'd rather not.'\",\n \"'We indeed!'\",\n 'cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of histail.',\n \"'As if I would talk on such a subject!\",\n 'Our family always HATEDcats: nasty, low, vulgar things!',\n \"Don't let me hear the name again!'\",\n \"'I won't indeed!'\",\n 'said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject ofconversation.',\n \"'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'\",\n \"The Mouse did notanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: 'There is such a nice little dog nearour house I should like to show you!\",\n 'A little bright-eyed terrier, youknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair!',\n \"And it'll fetch things whenyou throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sortsof things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!\",\n \"Hesays it kills all the rats and--oh dear!'\",\n \"cried Alice in a sorrowfultone, 'I'm afraid I've offended it again!'\",\n 'For the Mouse was swimmingaway from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion inthe pool as it went.',\n \"So she called softly after it, 'Mouse dear!\",\n \"Do come back again, and wewon't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!'\",\n \"When theMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: itsface was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a lowtrembling voice, 'Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you myhistory, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\",\n 'It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with thebirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.',\n 'Alice led theway, and the whole party swam to the shore.',\n 'CHAPTER III.',\n 'A Caucus-Race and a Long TaleThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--thebirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging closeto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.',\n 'The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had aconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite naturalto Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she hadknown them all her life.',\n \"Indeed, she had quite a long argument with theLory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, 'I am older thanyou, and must know better';
