      "01:012:004 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot\n",
      "           went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when\n",
      "           he departed out of Haran.\n",
      "01:012:005 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and\n",
      "           all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that\n",
      "           they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the\n",
      "           land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.\n",
      "01:012:006 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem,\n",
      "           unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the\n",
      "           land.\n",
      "01:012:007 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will\n",
      "           I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD,\n",
      "           who appeared unto him.\n",
      "01:012:008 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of\n",
      "           Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and\n",
      "           Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD,\n",
      "           and called upon the name of the LORD.\n",
      "01:012:009 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.\n",
      "01:012:010 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into\n",
      "           Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the\n",
      "           land.\n",
      "01:012:011 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into\n",
      "           Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know\n",
      "           that thou art a fair woman to look upon:\n",
      "01:012:012 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see\n",
      "           thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will\n",
      "           kill me, but they will save thee alive.\n",
      "01:012:013 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with\n",
      "           me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.\n",
      "01:012:014 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the\n",
      "           Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.\n",
      "01:012:015 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before\n",
      "           Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.\n",
      "01:012:016 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep,\n",
      "           and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and\n",
      "           she asses, and camels.\n",
      "01:012:017 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues\n",
      "           because of Sarai Abram's wife.\n",
      "01:012:018 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast\n",
      "           done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy\n",
      "           wife?\n",
      "01:012:019 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her\n",
      "           to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go\n",
      "           thy way.\n",
      "01:012:020 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent\n",
      "           him away, and his wife, and all that he had.\n",
      "01:013:001 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that\n",
      "           he had, and Lot with him, into the south.\n",
      "01:013:002 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.\n",
      "01:013:003 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel,\n",
      "           unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning,\n",
      "           between Bethel and Hai;\n",
      "01:013:004 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the\n",
      "           first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.\n",
      "01:013:005 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,\n",
      "           and tents.\n",
      "01:013:006 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell\n",
      "           together: for their substance was great, so that they could\n",
      "           not dwell together.\n",
      "01:013:007 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle\n",
      "           and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the\n",
      "           Perizzite dwelled then in the land.\n",
      "01:013:008 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,\n",
      "           between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;\n",
      "           for we be brethren.\n",
      "01:013:009 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray\n",
      "           thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go\n",
      "           to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will\n",
      "           go to the left.\n",
      "01:013:010 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of\n",
      "           Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD\n",
      "           destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD,\n",
      "           like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.\n",
      "01:013:011 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed\n",
      "           east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.\n",
      "01:013:012 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the\n",
      "           cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.\n",
      "01:013:013 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD\n",
      "           exceedingly.\n",
      "01:013:014 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated\n",
      "           from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place\n",
      "           where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and\n",
      "           westward:\n",
      "01:013:015 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and\n",
      "           to thy seed for ever.\n",
      "01:013:016 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if\n",
      "           a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed\n",
      "           also be numbered.\n",
      "01:013:017 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the\n",
      "           breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.\n",
      "01:013:018 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain\n",
      "           of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto\n",
      "           the LORD.\n",
      "01:014:001 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,\n",
      "           Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal\n",
      "           king of nations;\n",
      "01:014:002 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha\n",
      "           king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of\n",
      "           Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.\n",
      "01:014:003 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is\n",
      "           the salt sea.\n",
      "01:014:004 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth\n",
      "           year they rebelled.\n",
      "01:014:005 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings\n",
      "           that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth\n",
      "           Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh\n",
      "           Kiriathaim,\n",
      "01:014:006 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by\n",
      "           the wilderness.\n",
      "01:014:007 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and\n",
      "           smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the\n",
      "           Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.\n",
      "01:014:008 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of\n",
      "           Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and\n",
      "           the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle\n",
      "           with them in the vale of Siddim;\n",
      "01:014:009 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of\n",
      "           nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of\n",
      "           Ellasar; four kings with five.\n",
      "01:014:010 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of\n",
      "           Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that\n",
      "           remained fled to the mountain.\n",
      "01:014:011 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all\n",
      "           their victuals, and went their way.\n",
      "01:014:012 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,\n",
      "           and his goods, and departed.\n",
      "01:014:013 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the\n",
      "           Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite,\n",
      "           brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were\n",
      "           confederate with Abram.\n",
      "01:014:014 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he\n",
      "           armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three\n",
      "           hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.\n",
      "01:014:015 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by\n",
      "           night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is\n",
      "           on the left hand of Damascus.\n",
      "01:014:016 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his\n",
      "           brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the\n",
      "           people.\n",
      "01:014:017 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return\n",
      "           from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were\n",
      "           with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.\n",
      "01:014:018 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:\n",
      "           and he was the priest of the most high God.\n",
      "01:014:019 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most\n",
      "           high God, possessor of heaven and earth:\n",
      "01:014:020 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine\n",
      "           enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.\n",
      "01:014:021 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons,\n",
      "           and take the goods to thyself.\n",
      "01:014:022 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand\n",
      "           unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and\n",
      "           earth,\n",
      "01:014:023 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and\n",
      "           that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou\n",
      "           shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:\n",
      "01:014:024 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion\n",
      "           of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let\n",
      "           them take their portion.\n",
      "01:015:001 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a\n",
      "           vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy\n",
      "           exceeding great reward.\n",
      "01:015:002 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go\n",
      "           childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of\n",
      "           Damascus?\n",
      "01:015:003 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and,\n",
      "           lo, one born in my house is mine heir.\n",
      "01:015:004 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This\n",
      "           shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of\n",
      "           thine own bowels shall be thine heir.\n",
      "01:015:005 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward\n",
      "           heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them:\n",
      "           and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.\n",
      "01:015:006 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for\n",
      "           righteousness.\n",
      "01:015:007 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of\n",
      "           Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.\n",
      "01:015:008 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall\n",
      "           inherit it?\n",
      "01:015:009 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,\n",
      "           and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years\n",
      "           old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.\n",
      "01:015:010 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,\n",
      "           and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided\n",
      "           he not.\n",
      "01:015:011 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove\n",
      "           them away.\n",
      "01:015:012 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;\n",
      "           and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.\n",
      "01:015:013 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall\n",
      "           be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve\n",
      "           them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;\n",
      "01:015:014 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and\n",
      "           afterward shall they come out with great substance.\n",
      "01:015:015 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be\n",
      "           buried in a good old age.\n",
      "01:015:016 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for\n",
      "           the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\n",
      "01:015:017 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was\n",
      "           dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed\n",
      "           between those pieces.\n",
      "01:015:018 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,\n",
      "           Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt\n",
      "           unto the great river, the river Euphrates:\n",
      "01:015:019 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,\n",
      "01:015:020 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,\n",
      "01:015:021 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and\n",
      "           the Jebusites.\n",
      "01:016:001 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an\n",
      "           handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.\n",
      "01:016:002 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath\n",
      "           restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid;\n",
      "           it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram\n",
      "           hearkened to the voice of Sarai.\n",
      "01:016:003 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after\n",
      "           Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her\n",
      "           to her husband Abram to be his wife.\n",
      "01:016:004 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw\n",
      "           that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.\n",
      "01:016:005 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given\n",
      "           my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had\n",
      "           conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between\n",
      "           me and thee.\n",
      "01:016:006 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand;\n",
      "           do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly\n",
      "           with her, she fled from her face.\n",
      "01:016:007 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in\n",
      "           the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.\n",
      "01:016:008 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and\n",
      "           whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my\n",
      "           mistress Sarai.\n",
      "01:016:009 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy\n",
      "           mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.\n",
      "01:016:010 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy\n",

      "01:016:013 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou\n",

      "01:017:010 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you\n",

      "01:017:014 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is\n",

      "           he hath broken my covenant.\n",

      "01:018:007 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and\n",
      "           good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.\n",
      "01:018:008 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had\n",
      "           dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under\n",
      "           the tree, and they did eat.\n",
      "01:018:009 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,\n",
      "           Behold, in the tent.\n",
      "01:018:010 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to\n",
      "           the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.\n",
      "           And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.\n",
      "01:018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and\n",
      "           it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.\n",
      "01:018:012 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am\n",
      "           waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\n",
      "01:018:013 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,\n",
      "           saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?\n",
      "01:018:014 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I\n",
      "           will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and\n",
      "           Sarah shall have a son.\n",
      "01:018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.\n",
      "           And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.\n",
      "01:018:016 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and\n",
      "           Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.\n",
      "01:018:017 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which\n",
      "           I do;\n",
      "01:018:018 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty\n",
      "           nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in\n",
      "           him?\n",
      "01:018:019 For I know him, that he will command his children and his\n",
      "           household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD,\n",
      "           to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon\n",
      "           Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.\n",
      "01:018:020 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is\n",
      "           great, and because their sin is very grievous;\n",
      "01:018:021 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether\n",
      "           according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not,\n",
      "           I will know.\n",
      "01:018:022 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward\n",
      "           Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.\n",
      "01:018:023 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the\n",
      "           righteous with the wicked?\n",
      "01:018:024 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt\n",
      "           thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty\n",
      "           righteous that are therein?\n",
      "01:018:025 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the\n",
      "           righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as\n",
      "           the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all\n",
      "           the earth do right?\n",
      "01:018:026 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within\n",
      "           the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.\n",
      "01:018:027 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon\n",
      "           me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:\n",
      "01:018:028 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:\n",
      "           wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,\n",
      "           If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.\n",
      "01:018:029 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there\n",
      "           shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for\n",
      "           forty's sake.\n",
      "01:018:030 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will\n",
      "           speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he\n",
      "           said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.\n",
      "01:018:031 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto\n",
      "           the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And\n",
      "           he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.\n",
      "01:018:032 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak\n",
      "           yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And\n",
      "           he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.\n",
      "01:018:033 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing\n",
      "           with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.\n",
      "01:019:001 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the\n",
      "           gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and\n",
      "           he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;\n",
      "01:019:002 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into\n",
      "           your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,\n",
      "           and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they\n",
      "           said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.\n",
      "01:019:003 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,\n",
      "           and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did\n",
      "           bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.\n",
      "01:019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of\n",
      "           Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the\n",
      "           people from every quarter:\n",
      "01:019:005 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men\n",
      "           which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that\n",
      "           we may know them.\n",
      "01:019:006 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door\n",
      "           after him,\n",
      "01:019:007 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.\n",
      "01:019:008 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let\n",
      "           me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as\n",
      "           is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for\n",
      "           therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.\n",
      "01:019:009 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one\n",
      "           fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now\n",
      "           will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed\n",
      "           sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.\n",
      "01:019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the\n",
      "           house to them, and shut to the door.\n",
      "01:019:011 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with\n",
      "           blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied\n",
      "           themselves to find the door.\n",
      "01:019:012 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in\n",
      "           law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast\n",
      "           in the city, bring them out of this place:\n",
      "01:019:013 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is\n",
      "           waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath\n",
      "           sent us to destroy it.\n",
      "01:019:014 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which\n",
      "           married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this\n",
      "           place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as\n",
      "           one that mocked unto his sons in law.\n",
      "01:019:015 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,\n",
      "           saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are\n",
      "           here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.\n",
      "01:019:016 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and\n",
      "           upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two\n",
      "           daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought\n",
      "           him forth, and set him without the city.\n",
      "01:019:017 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,\n",
      "           that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,\n",
      "           neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain,\n",
      "           lest thou be consumed.\n",
      "01:019:018 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:\n",
      "01:019:019 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and\n",
      "           thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me\n",
      "           in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest\n",
      "           some evil take me, and I die:\n",
      "01:019:020 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little\n",
      "           one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and\n",
      "           my soul shall live.\n",
      "01:019:021 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning\n",
      "           this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the\n",
      "           which thou hast spoken.\n",
      "01:019:022 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou\n",
      "           be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called\n",
      "           Zoar.\n",
      "01:019:023 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.\n",
      "01:019:024 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone\n",
      "           and fire from the LORD out of heaven;\n",
      "01:019:025 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the\n",
      "           inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the\n",
      "           ground.\n",
      "01:019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a\n",
      "           pillar of salt.\n",
      "01:019:027 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he\n",
      "           stood before the LORD:\n",
      "01:019:028 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the\n",
      "           land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the\n",
      "           country went up as the smoke of a furnace.\n",
      "01:019:029 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the\n",
      "           plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the\n",
      "           midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the\n",
      "           which Lot dwelt.\n",
      "01:019:030 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and\n",
      "           his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar:\n",
      "           and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.\n",
      "01:019:031 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,\n",
      "           and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after\n",
      "           the manner of all the earth:\n",
      "01:019:032 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with\n",
      "           him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n",
      "01:019:033 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the\n",
      "           firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived\n",
      "           not when she lay down, nor when she arose.\n",
      "01:019:034 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said\n",
      "           unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:\n",
      "           let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,\n",
      "           and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.\n",
      "01:019:035 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the\n",
      "           younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she\n",
      "           lay down, nor when she arose.\n",
      "01:019:036 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their\n",
      "           father.\n",
      "01:019:037 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the\n",
      "           same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.\n",
      "01:019:038 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name\n",
      "           Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto\n",
      "           this day.\n",
      "01:020:001 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,\n",
      "           and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.\n",
      "01:020:002 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and\n",
      "           Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.\n",
      "01:020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to\n",
      "           him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou\n",
      "           hast taken; for she is a man's wife.\n",
      "01:020:004 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt\n",
      "           thou slay also a righteous nation?\n",
      "01:020:005 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she\n",
      "           herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart\n",
      "           and innocency of my hands have I done this.\n",
      "01:020:006 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst\n",
      "           this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee\n",
      "           from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to\n",
      "           touch her.\n",
      "01:020:007 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,\n",
      "           and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou\n",
      "           restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou,\n",
      "           and all that are thine.\n",
      "01:020:008 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all\n",
      "           his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the\n",
      "           men were sore afraid.\n",
      "01:020:009 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast\n",
      "           thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou\n",
      "           hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast\n",
      "           done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.\n",
      "01:020:010 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou\n",
      "           hast done this thing?\n",
      "01:020:011 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is\n",
      "           not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.\n",
      "01:020:012 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my\n",
      "           father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my\n",
      "           wife.\n",
      "01:020:013 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my\n",
      "           father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness\n",
      "           which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall\n",
      "           come, say of me, He is my brother.\n",
      "01:020:014 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and\n",
      "           womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him\n",
      "           Sarah his wife.\n",
      "01:020:015 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell\n",
      "           where it pleaseth thee.\n",
      "01:020:016 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a\n",
      "           thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of\n",
      "           the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other:\n",
      "           thus she was reproved.\n",
      "01:020:017 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his\n",
      "           wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.\n",
      "01:020:018 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of\n",
      "           Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.\n",
      "01:021:001 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did\n",
      "           unto Sarah as he had spoken.\n",
      "01:021:002 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at\n",
      "           the set time of which God had spoken to him.\n",
      "01:021:003 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,\n",
      "           whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.\n",
      "01:021:004 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as\n",
      "           God had commanded him.\n",
      "01:021:005 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was\n",
      "           born unto him.\n",
      "01:021:006 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that\n",
      "           hear will laugh with me.\n",
      "01:021:007 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah\n",
      "           should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in\n",
      "           his old age.\n",
      "01:021:008 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great\n",
      "           feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.\n",
      "01:021:009 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had\n",
      "           born unto Abraham, mocking.\n",
      "01:021:010 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and\n",
      "           her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with\n",
      "           my son, even with Isaac.\n",
      "01:021:011 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of\n",
      "           his son.\n",
      "01:021:012 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight\n",
      "           because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that\n",
      "           Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in\n",
      "           Isaac shall thy seed be called.\n",
      "01:021:013 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,\n",
      "           because he is thy seed.\n",
      "01:021:014 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and\n",
      "           a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her\n",
      "           shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed,\n",
      "           and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.\n",
      "01:021:015 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child\n",
      "           under one of the shrubs.\n",
      "01:021:016 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way\n",
      "           off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the\n",
      "           death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up\n",
      "           her voice, and wept.\n",
      "01:021:017 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God\n",
      "           called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth\n",
      "           thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad\n",
      "           where he is.\n",
      "01:021:018 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will\n",
      "           make him a great nation.\n",
      "01:021:019 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she\n",
      "           went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad\n",
      "           drink.\n",
      "01:021:020 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the\n",
      "           wilderness, and became an archer.\n",
      "01:021:021 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took\n",
      "           him a wife out of the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:021:022 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol\n",
      "           the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God\n",
      "           is with thee in all that thou doest:\n",
      "01:021:023 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not\n",
      "           deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son:\n",
      "           but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou\n",
      "           shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.\n",
      "01:021:024 And Abraham said, I will swear.\n",
      "01:021:025 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,\n",
      "           which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.\n",
      "01:021:026 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing;\n",
      "           neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to\n",
      "           day.\n",
      "01:021:027 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;\n",
      "           and both of them made a covenant.\n",
      "01:021:028 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.\n",
      "01:021:029 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe\n",
      "           lambs which thou hast set by themselves?\n",
      "01:021:030 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my\n",
      "           hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged\n",
      "           this well.\n",
      "01:021:031 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they\n",
      "           sware both of them.\n",
      "01:021:032 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose\n",
      "           up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they\n",
      "           returned into the land of the Philistines.\n",
      "01:021:033 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on\n",
      "           the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.\n",
      "01:021:034 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.\n",
      "01:022:001 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt\n",
      "           Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here\n",
      "           I am.\n",
      "01:022:002 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou\n",
      "           lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him\n",
      "           there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I\n",
      "           will tell thee of.\n",
      "01:022:003 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,\n",
      "           and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and\n",
      "           clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went\n",
      "           unto the place of which God had told him.\n",
      "01:022:004 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the\n",
      "           place afar off.\n",
      "01:022:005 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the\n",
      "           ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come\n",
      "           again to you.\n",
      "01:022:006 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it\n",
      "           upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a\n",
      "           knife; and they went both of them together.\n",
      "01:022:007 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:\n",
      "           and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire\n",
      "           and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?\n",
      "01:022:008 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for\n",
      "           a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.\n",
      "01:022:009 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and\n",
      "           Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and\n",
      "           bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.\n",
      "01:022:010 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to\n",
      "           slay his son.\n",
      "01:022:011 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and\n",
      "           said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.\n",
      "01:022:012 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou\n",
      "           any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God,\n",
      "           seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.\n",
      "01:022:013 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind\n",
      "           him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went\n",
      "           and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in\n",
      "           the stead of his son.\n",
      "01:022:014 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it\n",
      "           is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be\n",
      "           seen.\n",
      "01:022:015 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven\n",
      "           the second time,\n",
      "01:022:016 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because\n",
      "           thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,\n",
      "           thine only son:\n",
      "01:022:017 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will\n",
      "           multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand\n",
      "           which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the\n",
      "           gate of his enemies;\n",
      "01:022:018 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;\n",
      "           because thou hast obeyed my voice.\n",
      "01:022:019 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and\n",
      "           went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.\n",
      "01:022:020 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told\n",
      "           Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children\n",
      "           unto thy brother Nahor;\n",
      "01:022:021 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father\n",
      "           of Aram,\n",
      "01:022:022 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.\n",
      "01:022:023 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to\n",
      "           Nahor, Abraham's brother.\n",
      "01:022:024 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,\n",
      "           and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.\n",
      "01:023:001 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these\n",
      "           were the years of the life of Sarah.\n",
      "01:023:002 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land\n",
      "           of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep\n",
      "           for her.\n",
      "01:023:003 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the\n",
      "           sons of Heth, saying,\n",
      "01:023:004 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession\n",
      "           of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my\n",
      "           sight.\n",
      "01:023:005 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,\n",
      "01:023:006 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the\n",
      "           choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall\n",
      "           withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury\n",
      "           thy dead.\n",
      "01:023:007 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the\n",
      "           land, even to the children of Heth.\n",
      "01:023:008 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I\n",
      "           should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for\n",
      "           me to Ephron the son of Zohar,\n",
      "01:023:009 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath,\n",
      "           which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is\n",
      "           worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace\n",
      "           amongst you.\n",
      "01:023:010 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the\n",
      "           Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of\n",
      "           Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city,\n",
      "           saying,\n",
      "01:023:011 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave\n",
      "           that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons\n",
      "           of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.\n",
      "01:023:012 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.\n",
      "01:023:013 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the\n",
      "           land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me:\n",
      "           I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I\n",
      "           will bury my dead there.\n",
      "01:023:014 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,\n",
      "01:023:015 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred\n",
      "           shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury\n",
      "           therefore thy dead.\n",
      "01:023:016 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to\n",
      "           Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the\n",
      "           sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money\n",
      "           with the merchant.\n",
      "01:023:017 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was\n",
      "           before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and\n",
      "           all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the\n",
      "           borders round about, were made sure\n",
      "01:023:018 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children\n",
      "           of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.\n",
      "01:023:019 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of\n",
      "           the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the\n",
      "           land of Canaan.\n",
      "01:023:020 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure\n",
      "           unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of\n",
      "           Heth.\n",
      "01:024:001 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD\n",
      "           had blessed Abraham in all things.\n",
      "01:024:002 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that\n",
      "           ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under\n",
      "           my thigh:\n",
      "01:024:003 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and\n",
      "           the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my\n",
      "           son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:\n",
      "01:024:004 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take\n",
      "           a wife unto my son Isaac.\n",
      "01:024:005 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not\n",
      "           be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy\n",
      "           son again unto the land from whence thou camest?\n",
      "01:024:006 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my\n",
      "           son thither again.\n",
      "01:024:007 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house,\n",
      "           and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and\n",
      "           that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this\n",
      "           land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take\n",
      "           a wife unto my son from thence.\n",
      "01:024:008 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou\n",

      "           thither again.\n",
      "01:024:009 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his\n",
      "           master, and sware to him concerning that matter.\n",
      "01:024:010 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,\n",
      "           and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his\n",

      "           came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down\n",
      "           unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me\n",
      "           drink, I pray thee.\n",
      "01:024:046 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her\n",

      "           also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.\n",
      "01:024:047 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she\n",
      "           said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare\n",

      "           right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.\n",
      "01:024:049 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell\n",

      "           to the left.\n",
      "01:024:050 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth\n",
      "           from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.\n",
      "01:024:051 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her\n",
      "           be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.\n",
      "01:024:052 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their\n",
      "           words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.\n",
      "01:024:053 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of\n",
      "           gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to\n",
      "           her brother and to her mother precious things.\n",
      "01:024:054 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,\n",
      "           and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he\n",
      "           said, Send me away unto my master.\n",
      "01:024:055 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with\n",
      "           us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.\n",
      "01:024:056 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath\n",
      "           prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.\n",
      "01:024:057 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her\n",
      "           mouth.\n",
      "01:024:058 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with\n",
      "           this man? And she said, I will go.\n",
      "01:024:059 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and\n",
      "           Abraham's servant, and his men.\n",
      "01:024:060 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our\n",
      "           sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let\n",
      "           thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.\n",
      "01:024:061 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the\n",
      "           camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah,\n",
      "           and went his way.\n",
      "01:024:062 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt\n",
      "           in the south country.\n",
      "01:024:063 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide:\n",
      "           and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels\n",
      "           were coming.\n",
      "01:024:064 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she\n",
      "           lighted off the camel.\n",
      "01:024:065 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that\n",
      "           walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It\n",
      "           is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.\n",
      "01:024:066 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.\n",
      "01:024:067 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took\n",
      "           Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac\n",
      "           was comforted after his mother's death.\n",
      "01:025:001 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.\n",
      "01:025:002 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian,\n",
      "           and Ishbak, and Shuah.\n",
      "01:025:003 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were\n",
      "           Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.\n",
      "01:025:004 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and\n",
      "           Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.\n",
      "01:025:005 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.\n",
      "01:025:006 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had,\n",
      "           Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son,\n",
      "           while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.\n",
      "01:025:007 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he\n",
      "           lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.\n",
      "01:025:008 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an\n",
      "           old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.\n",
      "01:025:009 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of\n",
      "           Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the\n",
      "           Hittite, which is before Mamre;\n",
      "01:025:010 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there\n",
      "           was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.\n",
      "01:025:011 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God\n",
      "           blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.\n",
      "01:025:012 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom\n",
      "           Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:\n",
      "01:025:013 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their\n",
      "           names, according to their generations: the firstborn of\n",
      "           Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,\n",
      "01:025:014 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,\n",
      "01:025:015 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:\n",
      "01:025:016 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by\n",
      "           their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to\n",
      "           their nations.\n",
      "01:025:017 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and\n",
      "           thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and\n",
      "           was gathered unto his people.\n",
      "01:025:018 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt,\n",
      "           as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of\n",
      "           all his brethren.\n",
      "01:025:019 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham\n",
      "           begat Isaac:\n",
      "01:025:020 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife,\n",
      "           the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to\n",
      "           Laban the Syrian.\n",
      "01:025:021 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was\n",
      "           barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his\n",
      "           wife conceived.\n",
      "01:025:022 And the children struggled together within her; and she said,\n",
      "           If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the\n",
      "           LORD.\n",
      "01:025:023 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and\n",
      "           two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and\n",
      "           the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and\n",
      "           the elder shall serve the younger.\n",
      "01:025:024 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,\n",
      "           there were twins in her womb.\n",
      "01:025:025 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment;\n",
      "           and they called his name Esau.\n",
      "01:025:026 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on\n",
      "           Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was\n",
      "           threescore years old when she bare them.\n",
      "01:025:027 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the\n",
      "           field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.\n",
      "01:025:028 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but\n",
      "           Rebekah loved Jacob.\n",
      "01:025:029 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he\n",
      "           was faint:\n",
      "01:025:030 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same\n",
      "           red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called\n",
      "           Edom.\n",
      "01:025:031 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.\n",
      "01:025:032 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what\n",
      "           profit shall this birthright do to me?\n",
      "01:025:033 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him:\n",
      "           and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.\n",
      "01:025:034 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did\n",
      "           eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau\n",
      "           despised his birthright.\n",
      "01:026:001 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine\n",
      "           that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech\n",
      "           king of the Philistines unto Gerar.\n",
      "01:026:002 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into\n",
      "           Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:\n",
      "01:026:003 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless\n",
      "           thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these\n",
      "           countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto\n",
      "           Abraham thy father;\n",
      "01:026:004 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,\n",
      "           and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy\n",
      "           seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;\n",
      "01:026:005 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my\n",
      "           commandments, my statutes, and my laws.\n",
      "01:026:006 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:\n",
      "01:026:007 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said,\n",
      "           She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest,\n",
      "           said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah;\n",
      "           because she was fair to look upon.\n",
      "01:026:008 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that\n",
      "           Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and\n",
      "           saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.\n",
      "01:026:009 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she\n",
      "           is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac\n",
      "           said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.\n",
      "01:026:010 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one\n",
      "           of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou\n",
      "           shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.\n",
      "01:026:011 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth\n",
      "           this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.\n",
      "01:026:012 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year\n",
      "           an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.\n",
      "01:026:013 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he\n",
      "           became very great:\n",
      "01:026:014 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and\n",
      "           great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.\n",
      "01:026:015 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in\n",
      "           the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped\n",
      "           them, and filled them with earth.\n",
      "01:026:016 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much\n",
      "           mightier than we.\n",
      "01:026:017 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley\n",
      "           of Gerar, and dwelt there.\n",
      "01:026:018 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had\n",
      "           digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines\n",
      "           had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called\n",
      "           their names after the names by which his father had called\n",
      "           them.\n",
      "01:026:019 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a\n",
      "           well of springing water.\n",
      "01:026:020 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,\n",
      "           saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well\n",
      "           Esek; because they strove with him.\n",
      "01:026:021 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he\n",
      "           called the name of it Sitnah.\n",
      "01:026:022 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for\n",
      "           that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth;\n",
      "           and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we\n",
      "           shall be fruitful in the land.\n",
      "01:026:023 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.\n",
      "01:026:024 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am\n",
      "           the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee,\n",
      "           and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant\n",
      "           Abraham's sake.\n",
      "01:026:025 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the\n",
      "           LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants\n",
      "           digged a well.\n",
      "01:026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his\n",
      "           friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.\n",
      "01:026:027 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye\n",
      "           hate me, and have sent me away from you?\n",
      "01:026:028 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee:\n",
      "           and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt\n",
      "           us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;\n",
      "01:026:029 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and\n",
      "           as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee\n",
      "           away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.\n",
      "01:026:030 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.\n",
      "01:026:031 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to\n",
      "           another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him\n",
      "           in peace.\n",
      "01:026:032 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,\n",
      "           and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and\n",
      "           said unto him, We have found water.\n",
      "01:026:033 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is\n",
      "           Beersheba unto this day.\n",
      "01:026:034 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the\n",
      "           daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of\n",
      "           Elon the Hittite:\n",
      "01:026:035 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.\n",
      "01:027:001 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes\n",
      "           were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest\n",
      "           son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,\n",
      "           here am I.\n",
      "01:027:002 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my\n",
      "           death:\n",
      "01:027:003 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and\n",
      "           thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;\n",
      "01:027:004 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me,\n",
      "           that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.\n",
      "01:027:005 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau\n",
      "           went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.\n",
      "01:027:006 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard\n",
      "           thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,\n",
      "01:027:007 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat,\n",
      "           and bless thee before the LORD before my death.\n",
      "01:027:008 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I\n",
      "           command thee.\n",
      "01:027:009 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of\n",
      "           the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father,\n",
      "           such as he loveth:\n",
      "01:027:010 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and\n",
      "           that he may bless thee before his death.\n",
      "01:027:011 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother\n",
      "           is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:\n",
      "01:027:012 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him\n",
      "           as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a\n",
      "           blessing.\n",
      "01:027:013 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:\n",
      "           only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.\n",
      "01:027:014 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and\n",
      "           his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.\n",
      "01:027:015 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which\n",
      "           were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her\n",
      "           younger son:\n",
      "01:027:016 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,\n",
      "           and upon the smooth of his neck:\n",
      "01:027:017 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had\n",
      "           prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.\n",
      "01:027:018 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,\n",
      "           Here am I; who art thou, my son?\n",
      "01:027:019 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I\n",
      "           have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit\n",
      "           and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n",
      "01:027:020 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it\n",
      "           so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God\n",
      "           brought it to me.\n",
      "01:027:021 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may\n",
      "           feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.\n",
      "01:027:022 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him,\n",
      "           and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the\n",
      "           hands of Esau.\n",
      "01:027:023 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his\n",
      "           brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.\n",
      "01:027:024 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.\n",
      "01:027:025 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's\n",
      "           venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near\n",
      "           to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.\n",
      "01:027:026 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss\n",
      "           me, my son.\n",
      "01:027:027 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of\n",
      "           his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my\n",
      "           son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:\n",
      "01:027:028 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness\n",
      "           of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:\n",
      "01:027:029 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord\n",
      "           over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:\n",
      "           cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that\n",
      "           blesseth thee.\n",
      "01:027:030 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of\n",
      "           blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the\n",
      "           presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in\n",
      "           from his hunting.\n",
      "01:027:031 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his\n",
      "           father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat\n",
      "           of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.\n",
      "01:027:032 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said,\n",
      "           I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.\n",
      "01:027:033 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is\n",
      "           he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have\n",
      "           eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea,\n",
      "           and he shall be blessed.\n",
      "01:027:034 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a\n",
      "           great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father,\n",
      "           Bless me, even me also, O my father.\n",
      "01:027:035 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken\n",
      "           away thy blessing.\n",
      "01:027:036 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath\n",
      "           supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright;\n",
      "           and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said,\n",
      "           Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?\n",
      "01:027:037 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him\n",
      "           thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for\n",
      "           servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and\n",
      "           what shall I do now unto thee, my son?\n",
      "01:027:038 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my\n",
      "           father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted\n",
      "           up his voice, and wept.\n",
      "01:027:039 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy\n",
      "           dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of\n",
      "           heaven from above;\n",
      "01:027:040 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother;\n",
      "           and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion,\n",
      "           that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.\n",
      "01:027:041 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his\n",
      "           father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of\n",
      "           mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my\n",
      "           brother Jacob.\n",
      "01:027:042 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah:\n",
      "           and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto\n",
      "           him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort\n",
      "           himself, purposing to kill thee.\n",
      "01:027:043 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to\n",
      "           Laban my brother to Haran;\n",
      "01:027:044 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn\n",
      "           away;\n",
      "01:027:045 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget\n",
      "           that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch\n",
      "           thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in\n",
      "           one day?\n",
      "01:027:046 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of\n",
      "           the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters\n",
      "           of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land,\n",
      "           what good shall my life do me?\n",
      "01:028:001 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and\n",
      "           said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of\n",
      "           Canaan.\n",
      "01:028:002 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's\n",
      "           father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of\n",
      "           Laban thy mother's brother.\n",
      "01:028:003 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and\n",
      "           multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;\n",
      "01:028:004 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy\n",
      "           seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou\n",
      "           art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.\n",
      "01:028:005 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto\n",
      "           Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah,\n",
      "           Jacob's and Esau's mother.\n",
      "01:028:006 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away\n",
      "           to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he\n",
      "           blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take\n",
      "           a wife of the daughers of Canaan;\n",
      "01:028:007 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone\n",
      "           to Padanaram;\n",
      "01:028:008 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac\n",
      "           his father;\n",
      "01:028:009 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he\n",
      "           had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister\n",
      "           of Nebajoth, to be his wife.\n",
      "01:028:010 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.\n",
      "01:028:011 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all\n",
      "           night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of\n",
      "           that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that\n",
      "           place to sleep.\n",
      "01:028:012 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and\n",
      "           the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God\n",
      "           ascending and descending on it.\n",
      "01:028:013 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD\n",
      "           God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land\n",
      "           whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;\n",
      "01:028:014 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt\n",
      "           spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north,\n",
      "           and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the\n",
      "           families of the earth be blessed.\n",
      "01:028:015 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places\n",
      "           whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land;\n",
      "           for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have\n",
      "           spoken to thee of.\n",
      "01:028:016 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the\n",
      "           LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.\n",
      "01:028:017 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this\n",
      "           is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of\n",
      "           heaven.\n",
      "01:028:018 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone\n",
      "           that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar,\n",
      "           and poured oil upon the top of it.\n",
      "01:028:019 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of\n",
      "           that city was called Luz at the first.\n",
      "01:028:020 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and\n",
      "           will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to\n",
      "           eat, and raiment to put on,\n",
      "01:028:021 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall\n",
      "           the LORD be my God:\n",
      "01:028:022 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's\n",
      "           house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give\n",
      "           the tenth unto thee.\n",
      "01:029:001 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the\n",
      "           people of the east.\n",
      "01:029:002 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there\n",
      "           were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well\n",
      "           they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's\n",
      "           mouth.\n",
      "01:029:003 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the\n",
      "           stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put\n",
      "           the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.\n",
      "01:029:004 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they\n",
      "           said, Of Haran are we.\n",
      "01:029:005 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And\n",
      "           they said, We know him.\n",
      "01:029:006 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:\n",
      "           and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.\n",
      "01:029:007 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that\n",
      "           the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep,\n",
      "           and go and feed them.\n",
      "01:029:008 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered\n",
      "           together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth;\n",
      "           then we water the sheep.\n",
      "01:029:009 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her\n",
      "           father's sheep; for she kept them.\n",
      "01:029:010 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of\n",
      "           Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his\n",
      "           mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone\n",
      "           from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his\n",
      "           mother's brother.\n",
      "01:029:011 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.\n",
      "01:029:012 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and\n",
      "           that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.\n",
      "01:029:013 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his\n",
      "           sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and\n",
      "           kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban\n",
      "           all these things.\n",
      "01:029:014 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.\n",
      "           And he abode with him the space of a month.\n",
      "01:029:015 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,\n",
      "           shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what\n",
      "           shall thy wages be?\n",
      "01:029:016 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah,\n",
      "           and the name of the younger was Rachel.\n",
      "01:029:017 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well\n",
      "           favoured.\n",
      "01:029:018 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven\n",
      "           years for Rachel thy younger daughter.\n",
      "01:029:019 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than\n",
      "           that I should give her to another man: abide with me.\n",
      "01:029:020 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto\n",
      "           him but a few days, for the love he had to her.\n",
      "01:029:021 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are\n",
      "           fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.\n",
      "01:029:022 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made\n",
      "           a feast.\n",
      "01:029:023 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his\n",
      "           daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.\n",
      "01:029:024 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an\n",
      "           handmaid.\n",
      "01:029:025 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:\n",
      "           and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did\n",
      "           not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou\n",
      "           beguiled me?\n",
      "01:029:026 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give\n",
      "           the younger before the firstborn.\n",
      "01:029:027 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the\n",
      "           service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.\n",
      "01:029:028 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him\n",
      "           Rachel his daughter to wife also.\n",
      "01:029:029 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to\n",
      "           be her maid.\n",
      "01:029:030 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more\n",
      "           than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.\n",
      "01:029:031 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:\n",
      "           but Rachel was barren.\n",
      "01:029:032 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name\n",
      "           Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my\n",
      "           affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.\n",
      "01:029:033 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the\n",
      "           LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this\n",
      "           son also: and she called his name Simeon.\n",
      "01:029:034 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this\n",
      "           time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born\n",
      "           him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.\n",
      "01:029:035 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now\n",
      "           will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah;\n",
      "           and left bearing.\n",
      "01:030:001 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel\n",
      "           envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or\n",
      "           else I die.\n",
      "01:030:002 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am\n",
      "           I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the\n",
      "           womb?\n",
      "01:030:003 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she\n",
      "           shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by\n",
      "           her.\n",
      "01:030:004 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went\n",
      "           in unto her.\n",
      "01:030:005 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.\n",
      "01:030:006 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my\n",
      "           voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name\n",
      "           Dan.\n",
      "01:030:007 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a\n",
      "           second son.\n",
      "01:030:008 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my\n",
      "           sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name\n",
      "           Naphtali.\n",
      "01:030:009 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her\n",
      "           maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.\n",
      "01:030:010 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.\n",
      "01:030:011 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.\n",
      "01:030:012 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.\n",
      "01:030:013 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me\n",
      "           blessed: and she called his name Asher.\n",
      "01:030:014 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found\n",
      "           mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah.\n",
      "           Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's\n",
      "           mandrakes.\n",
      "01:030:015 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast\n",
      "           taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's\n",
      "           mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with\n",
      "           thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.\n",
      "01:030:016 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went\n",
      "           out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for\n",
      "           surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay\n",
      "           with her that night.\n",
      "01:030:017 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob\n",
      "           the fifth son.\n",
      "01:030:018 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given\n",
      "           my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.\n",
      "01:030:019 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.\n",
      "01:030:020 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will\n",
      "           my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons:\n",
      "           and she called his name Zebulun.\n",
      "01:030:021 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.\n",
      "01:030:022 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and\n",
      "           opened her womb.\n",
      "01:030:023 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken\n",
      "           away my reproach:\n",
      "01:030:024 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add\n",
      "           to me another son.\n",
      "01:030:025 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob\n",
      "           said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own\n",
      "           place, and to my country.\n",
      "01:030:026 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,\n",
      "           and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done\n",
      "           thee.\n",
      "01:030:027 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour\n",
      "           in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that\n",
      "           the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.\n",
      "01:030:028 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.\n",
      "01:030:029 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and\n",
      "           how thy cattle was with me.\n",
      "01:030:030 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is\n",
      "           now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee\n",
      "           since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own\n",
      "           house also?\n",
      "01:030:031 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou\n",
      "           shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for\n",
      "           me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.\n",
      "01:030:032 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence\n",
      "           all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle\n",
      "           among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats:\n",
      "           and of such shall be my hire.\n",
      "01:030:033 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when\n",
      "           it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is\n",
      "           not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the\n",
      "           sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.\n",
      "01:030:034 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy\n",
      "           word.\n",
      "01:030:035 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and\n",
      "           spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,\n",
      "           and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown\n",
      "           among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.\n",
      "01:030:036 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and\n",
      "           Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.\n",
      "01:030:037 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and\n",
      "           chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the\n",
      "           white appear which was in the rods.\n",
      "01:030:038 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in\n",
      "           the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to\n",
      "           drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.\n",
      "01:030:039 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth\n",
      "           cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.\n",
      "01:030:040 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the\n",
      "           flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock\n",
      "           of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put\n",
      "           them not unto Laban's cattle.\n",
      "01:030:041 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did\n",
      "           conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the\n",
      "           cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the\n",
      "           rods.\n",
      "01:030:042 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the\n",
      "           feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.\n",
      "01:030:043 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and\n",
      "           maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.\n",
      "01:031:001 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath\n",
      "           taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was\n",
      "           our father's hath he gotten all this glory.\n",
      "01:031:002 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was\n",
      "           not toward him as before.\n",
      "01:031:003 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy\n",
      "           fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.\n",
      "01:031:004 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto\n",
      "           his flock,\n",
      "01:031:005 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it\n",
      "           is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been\n",
      "           with me.\n",
      "01:031:006 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.\n",
      "01:031:007 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten\n",
      "           times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.\n",
      "01:031:008 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the\n",
      "           cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked\n",
      "           shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.\n",
      "01:031:009 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given\n",
      "           them to me.\n",
      "01:031:010 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived,\n",
      "           that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold,\n",
      "           the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked,\n",
      "           speckled, and grisled.\n",
      "01:031:011 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:\n",
      "           And I said, Here am I.\n",
      "01:031:012 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams\n",
      "           which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and\n",
      "           grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.\n",
      "01:031:013 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and\n",
      "           where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from\n",
      "           this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.\n",
      "01:031:014 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet\n",
      "           any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?\n",
      "01:031:015 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and\n",
      "           hath quite devoured also our money.\n",
      "01:031:016 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that\n",
      "           is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath\n",
      "           said unto thee, do.\n",
      "01:031:017 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon\n",
      "           camels;\n",
      "01:031:018 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he\n",
      "           had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in\n",
      "           Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of\n",
      "           Canaan.\n",
      "01:031:019 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the\n",
      "           images that were her father's.\n",
      "01:031:020 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he\n",
      "           told him not that he fled.\n",
      "01:031:021 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed\n",
      "           over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.\n",
      "01:031:022 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.\n",
      "01:031:023 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven\n",
      "           days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.\n",
      "01:031:024 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said\n",
      "           unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good\n",
      "           or bad.\n",
      "01:031:025 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in\n",
      "           the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of\n",
      "           Gilead.\n",
      "01:031:026 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast\n",
      "           stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as\n",
      "           captives taken with the sword?\n",
      "01:031:027 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from\n",
      "           me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away\n",
      "           with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?\n",
      "01:031:028 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?\n",
      "           thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.\n",
      "01:031:029 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of\n",
      "           your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed\n",
      "           that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.\n",
      "01:031:030 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore\n",
      "           longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou\n",
      "           stolen my gods?\n",
      "01:031:031 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:\n",
      "           for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy\n",
      "           daughters from me.\n",
      "01:031:032 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:\n",
      "           before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and\n",
      "           take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen\n",
      "           them.\n",
      "01:031:033 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and\n",
      "           into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then\n",
      "           went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.\n",
      "01:031:034 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's\n",
      "           furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,\n",
      "           but found them not.\n",
      "01:031:035 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that\n",
      "           I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon\n",
      "           me. And he searched but found not the images.\n",
      "01:031:036 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered\n",
      "           and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that\n",
      "           thou hast so hotly pursued after me?\n",
      "01:031:037 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found\n",
      "           of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and\n",
      "           thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.\n",
      "01:031:038 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she\n",
      "           goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock\n",
      "           have I not eaten.\n",
      "01:031:039 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare\n",
      "           the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether\n",
      "           stolen by day, or stolen by night.\n",
      "01:031:040 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost\n",
      "           by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.\n",
      "01:031:041 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee\n",
      "           fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy\n",
      "           cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.\n",
      "01:031:042 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear\n",
      "           of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now\n",
      "           empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my\n",
      "           hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.\n",
      "01:031:043 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my\n",
      "           daughters, and these children are my children, and these\n",
      "           cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and\n",
      "           what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their\n",
      "           children which they have born?\n",
      "01:031:044 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;\n",
      "           and let it be for a witness between me and thee.\n",
      "01:031:045 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.\n",
      "01:031:046 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took\n",
      "           stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the\n",
      "           heap.\n",
      "01:031:047 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it\n",
      "           Galeed.\n",
      "01:031:048 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee\n",
      "           this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;\n",
      "01:031:049 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee,\n",
      "           when we are absent one from another.\n",
      "01:031:050 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take\n",
      "           other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God\n",
      "           is witness betwixt me and thee.\n",
      "01:031:051 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this\n",
      "           pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:\n",
      "01:031:052 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will\n",
      "           not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass\n",
      "           over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.\n",
      "01:031:053 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their\n",
      "           father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his\n",
      "           father Isaac.\n",
      "01:031:054 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his\n",
      "           brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all\n",
      "           night in the mount.\n",
      "01:031:055 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons\n",
      "           and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and\n",
      "           returned unto his place.\n",
      "01:032:001 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.\n",
      "01:032:002 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he\n",
      "           called the name of that place Mahanaim.\n",
      "01:032:003 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto\n",
      "           the land of Seir, the country of Edom.\n",
      "01:032:004 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my\n",
      "           lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with\n",
      "           Laban, and stayed there until now:\n",
      "01:032:005 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and\n",
      "           womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may\n",
      "           find grace in thy sight.\n",
      "01:032:006 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy\n",
      "           brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four\n",
      "           hundred men with him.\n",
      "01:032:007 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided\n",
      "           the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and\n",
      "           the camels, into two bands;\n",
      "01:032:008 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then\n",
      "           the other company which is left shall escape.\n",
      "01:032:009 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my\n",
      "           father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy\n",
      "           country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:\n",
      "01:032:010 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all\n",
      "           the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with\n",
      "           my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two\n",
      "           bands.\n",
      "01:032:011 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the\n",
      "           hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,\n",
      "           and the mother with the children.\n",
      "01:032:012 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed\n",
      "           as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for\n",
      "           multitude.\n",
      "01:032:013 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which\n",
      "           came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;\n",
      "01:032:014 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,\n",
      "           and twenty rams,\n",
      "01:032:015 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten\n",
      "           bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.\n",
      "01:032:016 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every\n",
      "           drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over\n",
      "           before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.\n",
      "01:032:017 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother\n",
      "           meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and\n",
      "           whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?\n",
      "01:032:018 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a\n",
      "           present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind\n",
      "           us.\n",
      "01:032:019 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that\n",
      "           followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak\n",
      "           unto Esau, when ye find him.\n",
      "01:032:020 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.\n",
      "           For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth\n",
      "           before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he\n",
      "           will accept of me.\n",
      "01:032:021 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that\n",
      "           night in the company.\n",
      "01:032:022 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two\n",
      "           womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford\n",
      "           Jabbok.\n",
      "01:032:023 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over\n",
      "           that he had.\n",
      "01:032:024 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him\n",
      "           until the breaking of the day.\n",
      "01:032:025 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched\n",
      "           the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was\n",
      "           out of joint, as he wrestled with him.\n",
      "01:032:026 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I\n",
      "           will not let thee go, except thou bless me.\n",
      "01:032:027 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.\n",
      "01:032:028 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but\n",
      "           Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,\n",
      "           and hast prevailed.\n",
      "01:032:029 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.\n",
      "           And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?\n",
      "           And he blessed him there.\n",
      "01:032:030 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen\n",
      "           God face to face, and my life is preserved.\n",
      "01:032:031 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he\n",
      "           halted upon his thigh.\n",
      "01:032:032 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which\n",
      "           shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day:\n",
      "           because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew\n",
      "           that shrank.\n",
      "01:033:001 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau\n",
      "           came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the\n",
      "           children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two\n",
      "           handmaids.\n",
      "01:033:002 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah\n",
      "           and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.\n",
      "01:033:003 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the\n",
      "           ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.\n",
      "01:033:004 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his\n",
      "           neck, and kissed him: and they wept.\n",
      "01:033:005 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;\n",
      "           and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children\n",
      "           which God hath graciously given thy servant.\n",
      "01:033:006 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and\n",
      "           they bowed themselves.\n",
      "01:033:007 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed\n",
      "           themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they\n",
      "           bowed themselves.\n",
      "01:033:008 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?\n",
      "           And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.\n",
      "01:033:009 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast\n",
      "           unto thyself.\n",
      "01:033:010 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in\n",
      "           thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I\n",
      "           have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and\n",
      "           thou wast pleased with me.\n",
      "01:033:011 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee;\n",
      "           because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have\n",
      "           enough. And he urged him, and he took it.\n",
      "01:033:012 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I\n",
      "           will go before thee.\n",
      "01:033:013 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are\n",
      "           tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and\n",
      "           if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.\n",
      "01:033:014 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I\n",
      "           will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before\n",
      "           me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my\n",
      "           lord unto Seir.\n",
      "01:033:015 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk\n",
      "           that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find\n",
      "           grace in the sight of my lord.\n",
      "01:033:016 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.\n",
      "01:033:017 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and\n",
      "           made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is\n",
      "           called Succoth.\n",
      "01:033:018 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the\n",
      "           land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his\n",
      "           tent before the city.\n",
      "01:033:019 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his\n",
      "           tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father,\n",
      "           for an hundred pieces of money.\n",
      "01:033:020 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.\n",
      "01:034:001 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,\n",
      "           went out to see the daughters of the land.\n",
      "01:034:002 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the\n",
      "           country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled\n",
      "           her.\n",
      "01:034:003 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he\n",
      "           loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.\n",
      "01:034:004 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this\n",
      "           damsel to wife.\n",
      "01:034:005 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now\n",
      "           his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his\n",
      "           peace until they were come.\n",
      "01:034:006 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune\n",
      "           with him.\n",
      "01:034:007 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard\n",
      "           it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth,\n",
      "           because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's\n",
      "           daughter: which thing ought not to be done.\n",
      "01:034:008 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son\n",
      "           Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to\n",
      "           wife.\n",
      "01:034:009 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto\n",
      "           us, and take our daughters unto you.\n",
      "01:034:010 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;\n",
      "           dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.\n",
      "01:034:011 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me\n",
      "           find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will\n",
      "           give.\n",
      "01:034:012 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according\n",
      "           as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.\n",
      "01:034:013 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father\n",
      "           deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their\n",
      "           sister:\n",
      "01:034:014 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our\n",
      "           sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach\n",
      "           unto us:\n",
      "01:034:015 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,\n",
      "           that every male of you be circumcised;\n",
      "01:034:016 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take\n",
      "           your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will\n",
      "           become one people.\n",
      "01:034:017 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then\n",
      "           will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.\n",
      "01:034:018 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.\n",
      "01:034:019 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had\n",
      "           delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than\n",
      "           all the house of his father.\n",
      "01:034:020 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their\n",
      "           city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,\n",
      "01:034:021 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in\n",
      "           the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large\n",
      "           enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives,\n",
      "           and let us give them our daughters.\n",
      "01:034:022 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,\n",
      "           to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as\n",
      "           they are circumcised.\n",
      "01:034:023 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of\n",
      "           their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will\n",
      "           dwell with us.\n",
      "01:034:024 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that\n",
      "           went out of the gate of his city; and every male was\n",
      "           circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.\n",
      "01:034:025 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,\n",
      "           that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's\n",
      "           brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city\n",
      "           boldly, and slew all the males.\n",
      "01:034:026 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the\n",
      "           sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.\n",
      "01:034:027 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,\n",
      "           because they had defiled their sister.\n",
      "01:034:028 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and\n",
      "           that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,\n",
      "01:034:029 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their\n",
      "           wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the\n",
      "           house.\n",
      "01:034:030 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make\n",
      "           me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the\n",
      "           Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they\n",
      "           shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and\n",
      "           I shall be destroyed, I and my house.\n",

      "01:038:001 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from\n",
      "           his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose\n",
      "           name was Hirah.\n",
      "01:038:002 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose\n",
      "           name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.\n",
      "01:038:003 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.\n",
      "01:038:004 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his\n",
      "           name Onan.\n",
      "01:038:005 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his\n",
      "           name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.\n",
      "01:038:006 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was\n",
      "           Tamar.\n",
      "01:038:007 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the\n",
      "           LORD; and the LORD slew him.\n",
      "01:038:008 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and\n",
      "           marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.\n",
      "01:038:009 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to\n",
      "           pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled\n",
      "           it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his\n",
      "           brother.\n",
      "01:038:010 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he\n",
      "           slew him also.\n",
      "01:038:011 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow\n",
      "           at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he\n",
      "           said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And\n",
      "           Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.\n",
      "01:038:012 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife\n",
      "           died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his\n",
      "           sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the\n",
      "           Adullamite.\n",
      "01:038:013 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth\n",
      "           up to Timnath to shear his sheep.\n",
      "01:038:014 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her\n",
      "           with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place,\n",
      "           which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was\n",
      "           grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.\n",
      "01:038:015 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because\n",
      "           she had covered her face.\n",
      "01:038:016 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray\n",
      "           thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was\n",
      "           his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me,\n",
      "           that thou mayest come in unto me?\n",
      "01:038:017 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she\n",
      "           said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?\n",
      "01:038:018 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy\n",
      "           signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine\n",
      "           hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she\n",
      "           conceived by him.\n",
      "01:038:019 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her,\n",
      "           and put on the garments of her widowhood.\n",
      "01:038:020 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the\n",
      "           Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but\n",
      "           he found her not.\n",
      "01:038:021 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the\n",
      "           harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There\n",
      "           was no harlot in this place.\n",
      "01:038:022 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and\n",
      "           also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in\n",
      "           this place.\n",
      "01:038:023 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:\n",
      "           behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.\n",
      "01:038:024 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told\n",
      "           Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the\n",
      "           harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And\n",
      "           Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.\n",
      "01:038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,\n",
      "           saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she\n",
      "           said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and\n",
      "           bracelets, and staff.\n",
      "01:038:026 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more\n",
      "           righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my\n",
      "           son. And he knew her again no more.\n",
      "01:038:027 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,\n",
      "           twins were in her womb.\n",
      "01:038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out\n",
      "           his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a\n",
      "           scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.\n",
      "01:038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,\n",
      "           his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken\n",
      "           forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called\n",
      "           Pharez.\n",
      "01:038:030 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet\n",
      "           thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.\n",
      "01:039:001 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer\n",
      "           of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of\n",
      "           the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down\n",
      "           thither.\n",
      "01:039:002 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and\n",
      "           he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.\n",
      "01:039:003 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the\n",
      "           LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.\n",
      "01:039:004 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he\n",
      "           made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put\n",
      "           into his hand.\n",
      "01:039:005 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him\n",
      "           overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD\n",
      "           blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the\n",
      "           blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house,\n",
      "           and in the field.\n",
      "01:039:006 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not\n",
      "           ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was\n",
      "           a goodly person, and well favoured.\n",
      "01:039:007 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife\n",
      "           cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.\n",
      "01:039:008 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my\n",
      "           master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath\n",
      "           committed all that he hath to my hand;\n",
      "01:039:009 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he\n",
      "           kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his\n",
      "           wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against\n",
      "           God?\n",
      "01:039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that\n",
      "           he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.\n",
      "01:039:011 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the\n",
      "           house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the\n",
      "           house there within.\n",
      "01:039:012 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he\n",
      "           left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.\n",
      "01:039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment\n",
      "           in her hand, and was fled forth,\n",
      "01:039:014 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto\n",
      "           them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to\n",
      "           mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a\n",
      "           loud voice:\n",
      "01:039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice\n",
      "           and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got\n",
      "           him out.\n",
      "01:039:016 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.\n",
      "01:039:017 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The\n",
      "           Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto\n",
      "           me to mock me:\n",
      "01:039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that\n",
      "           he left his garment with me, and fled out.\n",
      "01:039:019 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his\n",
      "           wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did\n",
      "           thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.\n",
      "01:039:020 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a\n",
      "           place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there\n",
      "           in the prison.\n",
      "01:039:021 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave\n",
      "           him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.\n",
      "01:039:022 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all\n",
      "           the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did\n",
      "           there, he was the doer of it.\n",
      "01:039:023 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was\n",
      "           under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which\n",
      "           he did, the LORD made it to prosper.\n",
      "01:040:001 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the\n",
      "           king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king\n",
      "           of Egypt.\n",
      "01:040:002 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the\n",
      "           chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.\n",
      "01:040:003 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the\n",
      "           guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.\n",
      "01:040:004 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he\n",
      "           served them: and they continued a season in ward.\n",
      "01:040:005 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in\n",
      "           one night, each man according to the interpretation of his\n",
      "           dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which\n",
      "           were bound in the prison.\n",
      "01:040:006 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon\n",
      "           them, and, behold, they were sad.\n",
      "01:040:007 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward\n",
      "           of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to\n",
      "           day?\n",
      "01:040:008 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is\n",
      "           no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not\n",
      "           interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.\n",
      "01:040:009 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to\n",
      "           him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;\n",
      "01:040:010 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it\n",
      "           budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof\n",
      "           brought forth ripe grapes:\n",
      "01:040:011 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and\n",
      "           pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into\n",
      "           Pharaoh's hand.\n",
      "01:040:012 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:\n",
      "           The three branches are three days:\n",
      "01:040:013 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and\n",
      "           restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's\n",
      "           cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his\n",
      "           butler.\n",
      "01:040:014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew\n",
      "           kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto\n",
      "           Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:\n",
      "01:040:015 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:\n",
      "           and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into\n",
      "           the dungeon.\n",
      "01:040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he\n",
      "           said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had\n",
      "           three white baskets on my head:\n",
      "01:040:017 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of\n",
      "           bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the\n",
      "           basket upon my head.\n",
      "01:040:018 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation\n",
      "           thereof: The three baskets are three days:\n",
      "01:040:019 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off\n",
      "           thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat\n",
      "           thy flesh from off thee.\n",
      "01:040:020 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's\n",
      "           birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he\n",
      "           lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker\n",
      "           among his servants.\n",
      "01:040:021 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;\n",
      "           and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:\n",
      "01:040:022 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to\n",
      "           them.\n",
      "01:040:023 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.\n",
      "01:041:001 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh\n",
      "           dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.\n",
      "01:041:002 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well\n",
      "           favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.\n",
      "01:041:003 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the\n",
      "           river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other\n",
      "           kine upon the brink of the river.\n",
      "01:041:004 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven\n",
      "           well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.\n",
      "01:041:005 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven\n",
      "           ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.\n",
      "01:041:006 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind\n",
      "           sprung up after them.\n",
      "01:041:007 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.\n",
      "           And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.\n",
      "01:041:008 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was\n",
      "           troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of\n",
      "           Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his\n",
      "           dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto\n",
      "           Pharaoh.\n",
      "01:041:009 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do\n",
      "           remember my faults this day:\n",
      "01:041:010 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the\n",
      "           captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:\n",
      "01:041:011 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each\n",
      "           man according to the interpretation of his dream.\n",
      "01:041:012 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to\n",
      "           the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted\n",
      "           to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did\n",
      "           interpret.\n",
      "01:041:013 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he\n",
      "           restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.\n",
      "01:041:014 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him\n",
      "           hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed\n",
      "           his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.\n",
      "01:041:015 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and\n",
      "           there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of\n",
      "           thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.\n",
      "01:041:016 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God\n",
      "           shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.\n",
      "01:041:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood\n",
      "           upon the bank of the river:\n",
      "01:041:018 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,\n",
      "           fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:\n",
      "01:041:019 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and\n",
      "           very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all\n",
      "           the land of Egypt for badness:\n",
      "01:041:020 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first\n",
      "           seven fat kine:\n",
      "01:041:021 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that\n",
      "           they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at\n",
      "           the beginning. So I awoke.\n",
      "01:041:022 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one\n",
      "           stalk, full and good:\n",
      "01:041:023 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the\n",
      "           east wind, sprung up after them:\n",
      "01:041:024 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told\n",
      "           this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare\n",
      "           it to me.\n",
      "01:041:025 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God\n",
      "           hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.\n",
      "01:041:026 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears\n",
      "           are seven years: the dream is one.\n",
      "01:041:027 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after\n",
      "           them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with\n",
      "           the east wind shall be seven years of famine.\n",
      "01:041:028 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God\n",
      "           is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.\n",
      "01:041:029 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all\n",
      "           the land of Egypt:\n",
      "01:041:030 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and\n",
      "           all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and\n",
      "           the famine shall consume the land;\n",
      "01:041:031 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of\n",
      "           that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.\n",
      "01:041:032 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is\n",
      "           because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly\n",
      "           bring it to pass.\n",
      "01:041:033 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,\n",
      "           and set him over the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:034 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the\n",
      "           land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the\n",
      "           seven plenteous years.\n",
      "01:041:035 And let them gather all the food of those good years that\n",
      "           come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them\n",
      "           keep food in the cities.\n",
      "01:041:036 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven\n",
      "           years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the\n",
      "           land perish not through the famine.\n",
      "01:041:037 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes\n",
      "           of all his servants.\n",
      "01:041:038 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as\n",
      "           this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?\n",
      "01:041:039 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed\n",
      "           thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:\n",
      "01:041:040 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall\n",
      "           all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater\n",
      "           than thou.\n",
      "01:041:041 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all\n",
      "           the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:042 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon\n",
      "           Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and\n",
      "           put a gold chain about his neck;\n",
      "01:041:043 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had;\n",
      "           and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler\n",
      "           over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:044 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee\n",
      "           shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of\n",
      "           Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:045 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave\n",
      "           him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.\n",
      "           And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:046 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh\n",
      "           king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of\n",
      "           Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:047 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by\n",
      "           handfuls.\n",
      "01:041:048 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were\n",
      "           in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the\n",
      "           food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he\n",
      "           up in the same.\n",
      "01:041:049 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,\n",
      "           until he left numbering; for it was without number.\n",
      "01:041:050 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine\n",
      "           came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On\n",
      "           bare unto him.\n",
      "01:041:051 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,\n",
      "           said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's\n",
      "           house.\n",
      "01:041:052 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath\n",
      "           caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.\n",
      "01:041:053 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of\n",
      "           Egypt, were ended.\n",
      "01:041:054 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as\n",
      "           Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all\n",
      "           the land of Egypt there was bread.\n",
      "01:041:055 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried\n",
      "           to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians,\n",
      "           Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.\n",
      "01:041:056 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph\n",
      "           opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and\n",
      "           the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:041:057 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;\n",
      "           because that the famine was so sore in all lands.\n",
      "01:042:001 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said\n",
      "           unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?\n",
      "01:042:002 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt:\n",
      "           get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may\n",
      "           live, and not die.\n",
      "01:042:003 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.\n",
      "01:042:004 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his\n",
      "           brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.\n",
      "01:042:005 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:\n",
      "           for the famine was in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "01:042:006 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that\n",
      "           sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren\n",
      "           came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to\n",
      "           the earth.\n",
      "01:042:007 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made\n",
      "           himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he\n",
      "           said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land\n",
      "           of Canaan to buy food.\n",
      "01:042:008 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.\n",
      "01:042:009 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and\n",
      "           said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land\n",
      "           ye are come.\n",
      "01:042:010 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy\n",
      "           servants come.\n",
      "01:042:011 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are\n",
      "           no spies.\n",
      "01:042:012 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the\n",
      "           land ye are come.\n",
      "01:042:013 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of\n",
      "           one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is\n",
      "           this day with our father, and one is not.\n",
      "01:042:014 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,\n",
      "           saying, Ye are spies:\n",
      "01:042:015 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not\n",
      "           go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.\n",
      "01:042:016 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall\n",
      "           be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether\n",
      "           there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh\n",
      "           surely ye are spies.\n",
      "01:042:017 And he put them all together into ward three days.\n",
      "01:042:018 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;\n",
      "           for I fear God:\n",
      "01:042:019 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the\n",
      "           house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your\n",
      "           houses:\n",
      "01:042:020 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words\n",
      "           be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.\n",
      "01:042:021 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning\n",
      "           our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he\n",
      "           besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress\n",
      "           come upon us.\n",
      "01:042:022 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you,\n",
      "           saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear?\n",
      "           therefore, behold, also his blood is required.\n",
      "01:042:023 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake\n",
      "           unto them by an interpreter.\n",
      "01:042:024 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned\n",
      "           to them again, and communed with them, and took from them\n",
      "           Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.\n",
      "01:042:025 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to\n",
      "           restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them\n",
      "           provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.\n",
      "01:042:026 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.\n",
      "01:042:027 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender\n",
      "           in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his\n",
      "           sack's mouth.\n",
      "01:042:028 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,\n",
      "           it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they\n",
      "           were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath\n",
      "           done unto us?\n",
      "01:042:029 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,\n",
      "           and told him all that befell unto them; saying,\n",
      "01:042:030 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and\n",
      "           took us for spies of the country.\n",
      "01:042:031 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:\n",
      "01:042:032 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the\n",
      "           youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.\n",
      "01:042:033 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby\n",
      "           shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren\n",
      "           here with me, and take food for the famine of your households,\n",
      "           and be gone:\n",
      "01:042:034 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know\n",
      "           that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I\n",
      "           deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.\n",
      "01:042:035 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,\n",
      "           every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both\n",
      "           they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were\n",
      "           afraid.\n",
      "01:042:036 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of\n",
      "           my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will\n",
      "           take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.\n",
      "01:042:037 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if\n",
      "           I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will\n",
      "           bring him to thee again.\n",
      "01:042:038 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his\n",
      "           brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him\n",
      "           by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my\n",
      "           gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "01:043:001 And the famine was sore in the land.\n",
      "01:043:002 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which\n",
      "           they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go\n",
      "           again, buy us a little food.\n",
      "01:043:003 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest\n",
      "           unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother\n",
      "           be with you.\n",
      "01:043:004 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy\n",
      "           thee food:\n",
      "01:043:005 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the\n",
      "           man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your\n",
      "           brother be with you.\n",
      "01:043:006 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell\n",
      "           the man whether ye had yet a brother?\n",
      "01:043:007 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of\n",
      "           our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another\n",
      "           brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these\n",
      "           words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your\n",
      "           brother down?\n",
      "01:043:008 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me,\n",
      "           and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both\n",
      "           we, and thou, and also our little ones.\n",
      "01:043:009 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him:\n",
      "           if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then\n",
      "           let me bear the blame for ever:\n",
      "01:043:010 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this\n",
      "           second time.\n",
      "01:043:011 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now,\n",
      "           do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,\n",
      "           and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little\n",
      "           honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:\n",
      "01:043:012 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was\n",
      "           brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in\n",
      "           your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:\n",
      "01:043:013 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:\n",
      "01:043:014 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may\n",
      "           send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved\n",
      "           of my children, I am bereaved.\n",
      "01:043:015 And the men took that present, and they took double money in\n",
      "           their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt,\n",
      "           and stood before Joseph.\n",
      "01:043:016 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler\n",
      "           of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready;\n",
      "           for these men shall dine with me at noon.\n",
      "01:043:017 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men\n",
      "           into Joseph's house.\n",
      "01:043:018 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into\n",
      "           Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was\n",
      "           returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in;\n",
      "           that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and\n",
      "           take us for bondmen, and our asses.\n",
      "01:043:019 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they\n",
      "           communed with him at the door of the house,\n",
      "01:043:020 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy\n",
      "           food:\n",
      "01:043:021 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened\n",
      "           our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of\n",
      "           his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it\n",
      "           again in our hand.\n",
      "01:043:022 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:\n",
      "           we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.\n",
      "01:043:023 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God\n",
      "           of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had\n",
      "           your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.\n",
      "01:043:024 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them\n",
      "           water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses\n",
      "           provender.\n",
      "01:043:025 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:\n",
      "           for they heard that they should eat bread there.\n",
      "01:043:026 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which\n",
      "           was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him\n",
      "           to the earth.\n",
      "01:043:027 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father\n",
      "           well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?\n",
      "01:043:028 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health,\n",
      "           he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made\n",
      "           obeisance.\n",
      "01:043:029 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his\n",
      "           mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom\n",
      "           ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my\n",
      "           son.\n",
      "01:043:030 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his\n",
      "           brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his\n",
      "           chamber, and wept there.\n",
      "01:043:031 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself,\n",
      "           and said, Set on bread.\n",
      "01:043:032 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by\n",
      "           themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by\n",
      "           themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the\n",
      "           Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.\n",
      "01:043:033 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his\n",
      "           birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the\n",
      "           men marvelled one at another.\n",
      "01:043:034 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but\n",
      "           Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And\n",
      "           they drank, and were merry with him.\n",
      "01:044:001 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the\n",
      "           men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put\n",
      "           every man's money in his sack's mouth.\n",
      "01:044:002 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the\n",
      "           youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word\n",
      "           that Joseph had spoken.\n",
      "01:044:003 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they\n",
      "           and their asses.\n",
      "01:044:004 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,\n",
      "           Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and\n",
      "           when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye\n",
      "           rewarded evil for good?\n",
      "01:044:005 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed\n",
      "           he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.\n",
      "01:044:006 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.\n",
      "01:044:007 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?\n",
      "           God forbid that thy servants should do according to this\n",
      "           thing:\n",
      "01:044:008 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we\n",
      "           brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then\n",
      "           should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?\n",
      "01:044:009 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,\n",
      "           and we also will be my lord's bondmen.\n",
      "01:044:010 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he\n",
      "           with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be\n",
      "           blameless.\n",
      "01:044:011 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,\n",
      "           and opened every man his sack.\n",
      "01:044:012 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the\n",
      "           youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.\n",
      "01:044:013 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and\n",
      "           returned to the city.\n",
      "01:044:014 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was\n",
      "           yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.\n",
      "01:044:015 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have\n",
      "           done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?\n",
      "01:044:016 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we\n",
      "           speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the\n",
      "           iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants,\n",
      "           both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.\n",
      "01:044:017 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in\n",
      "           whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as\n",
      "           for you, get you up in peace unto your father.\n",
      "01:044:018 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy\n",
      "           servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let\n",
      "           not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as\n",
      "           Pharaoh.\n",
      "01:044:019 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a\n",
      "           brother?\n",
      "01:044:020 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a\n",
      "           child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead,\n",
      "           and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.\n",
      "01:044:021 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,\n",
      "           that I may set mine eyes upon him.\n",
      "01:044:022 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for\n",
      "           if he should leave his father, his father would die.\n",
      "01:044:023 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest\n",
      "           brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.\n",
      "01:044:024 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my\n",
      "           father, we told him the words of my lord.\n",
      "01:044:025 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.\n",
      "01:044:026 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be\n",
      "           with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's\n",
      "           face, except our youngest brother be with us.\n",
      "01:044:027 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife\n",
      "           bare me two sons:\n",
      "01:044:028 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in\n",
      "           pieces; and I saw him not since:\n",
      "01:044:029 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye\n",
      "           shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "01:044:030 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the\n",
      "           lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the\n",
      "           lad's life;\n",
      "01:044:031 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with\n",
      "           us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the\n",
      "           gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.\n",
      "01:044:032 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,\n",
      "           saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the\n",
      "           blame to my father for ever.\n",
      "01:044:033 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of\n",
      "           the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his\n",
      "           brethren.\n",
      "01:044:034 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with\n",
      "           me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my\n",
      "           father.\n",
      "01:045:001 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that\n",
      "           stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me.\n",
      "           And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself\n",
      "           known unto his brethren.\n",
      "01:045:002 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh\n",
      "           heard.\n",
      "01:045:003 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father\n",
      "           yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were\n",
      "           troubled at his presence.\n",
      "01:045:004 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray\n",
      "           you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your\n",
      "           brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.\n",
      "01:045:005 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that\n",
      "           ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve\n",
      "           life.\n",
      "01:045:006 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet\n",
      "           there are five years, in the which there shall neither be\n",
      "           earing nor harvest.\n",
      "01:045:007 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the\n",
      "           earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.\n",
      "01:045:008 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he\n",
      "           hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house,\n",
      "           and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.\n",
      "01:045:009 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith\n",
      "           thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down\n",
      "           unto me, tarry not:\n",
      "01:045:010 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be\n",
      "           near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's\n",
      "           children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou\n",
      "           hast:\n",
      "01:045:011 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of\n",
      "           famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast,\n",
      "           come to poverty.\n",
      "01:045:012 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother\n",
      "           Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.\n",
      "01:045:013 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of\n",
      "           all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my\n",
      "           father hither.\n",
      "01:045:014 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and\n",
      "           Benjamin wept upon his neck.\n",
      "01:045:015 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and\n",
      "           after that his brethren talked with him.\n",
      "01:045:016 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,\n",
      "           Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and\n",
      "           his servants.\n",
      "01:045:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do\n",
      "           ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;\n",
      "01:045:018 And take your father and your households, and come unto me:\n",
      "           and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye\n",
      "           shall eat the fat of the land.\n",
      "01:045:019 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the\n",
      "           land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and\n",
      "           bring your father, and come.\n",
      "01:045:020 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of\n",
      "           Egypt is your's.\n",
      "01:045:021 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them\n",
      "           wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them\n",
      "           provision for the way.\n",
      "01:045:022 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to\n",
      "           Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five\n",
      "           changes of raiment.\n",
      "01:045:023 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden\n",
      "           with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with\n",
      "           corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.\n",
      "01:045:024 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said\n",
      "           unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.\n",
      "01:045:025 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of\n",
      "           Canaan unto Jacob their father,\n",
      "01:045:026 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor\n",
      "           over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he\n",
      "           believed them not.\n",
      "01:045:027 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said\n",
      "           unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to\n",
      "           carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:\n",
      "01:045:028 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I\n",
      "           will go and see him before I die.\n",
      "01:046:001 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to\n",
      "           Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father\n",
      "           Isaac.\n",
      "01:046:002 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and\n",
      "           said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.\n",
      "01:046:003 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go\n",
      "           down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:\n",
      "01:046:004 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely\n",
      "           bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine\n",
      "           eyes.\n",
      "01:046:005 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel\n",
      "           carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their\n",
      "           wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.\n",
      "01:046:006 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had\n",
      "           gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and\n",
      "           all his seed with him:\n",
      "01:046:007 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his\n",
      "           sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into\n",
      "           Egypt.\n",
      "01:046:008 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came\n",
      "           into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.\n",
      "01:046:009 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and\n",

      "01:047:020 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the\n",
      "           Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine\n",
      "           prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.\n",
      "01:047:021 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end\n",
      "           of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.\n",
      "01:047:022 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests\n",
      "           had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their\n",
      "           portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their\n",
      "           lands.\n",
      "01:047:023 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you\n",

      "           and ye shall sow the land.\n",

      "01:047:025 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in\n",
      "           the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.\n",
      "01:047:026 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,\n",
      "           that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of\n",
      "           the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.\n",
      "01:047:027 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of\n",

      "01:047:029 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his\n",

      "           thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal\n",
      "           kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:\n",
      "01:047:030 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of\n",
      "           Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will\n",
      "           do as thou hast said.\n",
      "01:047:031 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel\n",
      "           bowed himself upon the bed's head.\n",
      "01:048:001 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,\n",
      "           Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,\n",
      "           Manasseh and Ephraim.\n",
      "01:048:002 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh\n",
      "           unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the\n",
      "           bed.\n",
      "01:048:003 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at\n",
      "           Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,\n",
      "01:048:004 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and\n",
      "           multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people;\n",
      "           and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an\n",
      "           everlasting possession.\n",
      "01:048:005 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born\n",
      "           unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into\n",
      "           Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.\n",
      "01:048:006 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be\n",
      "           thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in\n",
      "           their inheritance.\n",
      "01:048:007 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in\n",
      "           the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little\n",
      "           way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of\n",
      "           Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.\n",
      "01:048:008 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?\n",
      "01:048:009 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God\n",
      "           hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray\n",
      "           thee, unto me, and I will bless them.\n",
      "01:048:010 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not\n",
      "           see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them,\n",
      "           and embraced them.\n",
      "01:048:011 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy\n",
      "           face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.\n",
      "01:048:012 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he\n",
      "           bowed himself with his face to the earth.\n",
      "01:048:013 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward\n",
      "           Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward\n",
      "           Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.\n",
      "01:048:014 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon\n",
      "           Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon\n",
      "           Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was\n",
      "           the firstborn.\n",
      "01:048:015 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers\n",
      "           Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life\n",
      "           long unto this day,\n",
      "01:048:016 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and\n",
      "           let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers\n",

      "           midst of the earth.\n",
      "01:048:017 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon\n",
      "           the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his\n",
      "           father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto\n",
      "           Manasseh's head.\n",
      "01:048:018 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this\n",
      "           is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.\n",
      "01:048:019 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know\n",
      "           it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great:\n",
      "           but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and\n",
      "           his seed shall become a multitude of nations.\n",
      "01:048:020 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel\n",
      "           bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and\n",
      "           he set Ephraim before Manasseh.\n",
      "01:048:021 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be\n",
      "           with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.\n",
      "01:048:022 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,\n",
      "           which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and\n",
      "           with my bow.\n",
      "01:049:001 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves\n",
      "           together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in\n",
      "           the last days.\n",
      "01:049:002 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and\n",
